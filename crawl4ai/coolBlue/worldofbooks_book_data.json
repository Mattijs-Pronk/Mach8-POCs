Does the answer to the modern epidemic of ‘Western’ diseases lie in our gut?             You are 10% human. For every one of your cells, there are nine impostors hitching a ride. You are not just flesh and bone, but also bacteria and fungi. And you are more ‘them’ than you are ‘you’.             Your gut alone hosts 100 trillion of them and until recently we thought that our microbes didn’t matter. This is all set to change as the latest scientific research tells a very different story, one where microbes run our bodies and becoming healthy is impossible without them.             In this ground-breaking book, biologist Alanna Collen reveals how our personal colony of microbes influence our weight, immune system, mental health and even our choice of partner. This is a new way of understanding modern diseases – obesity, autism, mental health problems, gut disorders, allergies, auto-immunity and even cancer – as she argues they have their root in our failure to cherish our most fundamental and enduring relationship: that with our microbes.             Illuminating many of the questions still unanswered by the human genome project 10% Human completely changes our understanding of diet, modern disease and medicine. The good news is that unlike our human cells, we can change our microbes for the better and this book shows you how.

It can be dressed up - such as a starter of Angel Hair pasta with oysters, Vermouth, saffron and double cream, or it can be dressed down. Over 100 traditional and many new ideas for pasta sauce recipes are included in this book. The emphasis is on style and easy cooking so that very few culinary skills are required. Each recipe is clearly explained and includes tips and alternative suggestions. Divided into two sections, the first describes the range of oils, pastes and varieties of fresh and dried pasta, and explains the dos and don'ts of cooking it, and then presents the recipes. These are divided into classic sauces, the one-minute sauce, and sauces using vegetables, cheese and cream, meat, fish, herbs, spices and simple dressings for summer sauces.",

In the final debate of the 2016 US presidential election, Donald Trump leaned into the microphone as Hillary Clinton spoke about social security and called his opponent 'such a nasty woman'. The phrase has stuck around and has since become something of a badge of honour for women around the world.   What better time than now, then, for us to look back and learn a thing or two from the 'nasty' women of the past? Compiled and written by BuzzFeed writer Hannah Jewell, 100 Nasty Women of History contains profiles of women from across every century, race and continent, united in the fact that they were all a bit 'nasty'. From 3rd-century Japanese Empress Jingu to 20th-century British social reformer Octavia Hill, these are the women who were bold and powerful, but maybe put people (men's) backs up by being so. 100 Nasty Women of History is an accessible, intelligent, hilarious (and sometimes sweary) guide to the history-making women whom you probably don't know - but definitely should.",

        "summary": "The 100-Year Life by Lynda GrattonWhat will your 100-year life look like?  Does the thought of working for 60 or 70 years fill you with dread? Or can you see the potential for a more stimulating future as a result of having so much extra time?   Many of us have been raised on the traditional notion of a three-stage approach to our working lives: education, followed by work and then retirement.  But this well-established pathway is already beginning to collapse – life expectancy is rising, final-salary pensions are vanishing, and increasing numbers of people are juggling multiple careers. Whether you are 18, 45 or 60, you will need to do things very differently from previous generations and learn to structure your life in completely new ways.  The 100-Year Life is here to help.  Drawing on the unique pairing of their experience in psychology and economics, Lynda Gratton and Andrew Scott offer a broad-ranging analysis as well as a raft of solutions, showing how to rethink your finances, your education, your career and your relationships and create a fulfilling 100-year life.   · How can you fashion a career and life path that defines you and your values and creates a shifting balance between work and leisure?  · What are the most effective ways of boosting your physical and mental health over a longer and more dynamic lifespan?  · How can you make the most of your intangible assets – such as family and friends – as you build a productive, longer life?  · In a multiple-stage life how can you learn to make the transitions that will be so crucial and experiment with new ways of living, working and learning?  Shortlisted for the FT/McKinsey Business Book of the Year Award, The 100-Year Life is a wake-up call that describes what to expect and considers the choices and options that you will face. It is also fundamentally a call to action for individuals, politicians, firms and governments and offers the clearest demonstration that a 100-year life can be a wonderful and inspiring one.",

        "summary": "100 Years of Wildlife by Michael BrightEver since 1907, when a flickering film about birds enthralled a cinema audience, we've been fascinated by watching the natural world on film. For 100 years wildlife films have taken us to places and shown us things we would never be able to see - the excitement, the strangeness, the danger of the wild. Today, our interest in the wonders of the natural world is stronger than ever.  Accompanying the lavish BBC two-hour special, Top 100 Wildlife Moments dives into the archives to find the 100 wildlife moments that best celebrate the glories and the eccentricities of this astonishingly popular and enduring culture. Discover the history of the wildlife moving image: the first heady days when an ant juggling a matchbox was big box office; the charismatic and sometimes controversial celebrity presenters; the astonishing behaviour of animals and plants; the boggling oddities of nature; the animals now extinct that poignantly only exist on film.  Explore 100 years of revelation - from the black-and-white silent footage that started it all to the almost magical photography techniques seen today in programmes like Planet Earth. From famous faces of wildlife TV to extraordinary animal (and plant) behaviour, natural history filming has changed the way we look at and think about our world. It's all here - so weird, you couldn't make it up; so wonderful, you wouldn't want to miss it.",

Were the Brits really responsible for the death of Joan of Arc? Non! The French sentenced her to death for wearing trousers.  Was the guillotine a French invention? Non! It was invented in Yorkshire.  Ten centuries' worth of French historical 'facts' bite the dust as Stephen Clarke looks at what has really been going on since 1066 ...  From the Norman (not French) Conquest, to XXX, it is a light-hearted - but impeccably researched - account of all out great-fallings out.

        "summary": "1001 Guitars to Dream of Playing Before You Die by Terry BurrowsFind out why Chet Atkins had a Gretsch guitar named after him, why The Who's John Entwistle called his favourite guitar \"Frankenstein\", and how John Lennon elevated the Rickenbacker 325 to one of the most desirable guitar brands of the 1960's.  1001 Guitars to Dream of Playing Before Your Die showcases the greatest instruments from across the globe: some are of historical or cultural significance and some were made famous by well-known musicians; others are included as examples of technological breakthroughs, innovative design or extraordinary sound quality. From the earliest models produced by Belchior Dias in the sixteenth century to the latest Gibson \"Robot\" series of guitars with computer-controlled self-tuning capabilities and onboard sound-processing features, 1001 Guitars to Dream of Playing Before Your Die tells the fascinating stories behind the creation of each one.  All the classic names are here - Fender, Roland, Martin, Gretsch and Rickenbacker - as well as important Japanise brands, such as Ibanez, Yamaha and Teisco; European classics of the 1960's including Burns, Hagstrom, Eko and Hofner; obscure models from behind the \"Iron Curtain\", such as Defil, Aelita, Resonet and Musima; and present-day oil-can guitars built in South Africa. Never before have so many guitars been profiled within a single illustrated volume.  A striking colour photograph of each guitar is accompanied by specification details and illuminating text that traces the guitar's history and reveals which famous musicians like to play the instrument and on what albums it can be heard.

It is not an awards list. It is not a list of the 101 'best' whiskies in the world in the opinion of a self-appointed whisky guru. It is simply a guide to the 101 whiskies that enthusiasts must seek out and try in order to complete their whisky education.   Avoiding the deliberately obscure, the ridiculously limited and the absurdly expensive, whisky expert Ian Buxton recommends an eclectic selection of old favourites, stellar newcomers and mystifyingly unknown drams that simply have to be drunk.  The book decodes the marketing hype and gets straight to the point; whether from Canada, India, America, Sweden, Ireland, Japan or the hills, glens and islands of Scotland, here are the 101 whiskies that you really want.

Of the millions of words written about this wrenching day, most were told from the outside looking in. \"New York Times\" reporters Jim Dwyer and Kevin Flynn draw on hundreds of interviews with rescuers and survivors, thousands of pages of oral histories, and countless phone, e-mail, and emergency radio transcripts to tell the story of September 11 from the inside looking out. Dwyer and Flynn have woven an epic and unforgettable account of the struggle, determination, and grace of the ordinary men and women who made 102 minutes count as never before.",

A hugely visible and controversial part of the global game, their credo and aesthetic replicated in almost every league everywhere on earth, a global movement of extreme fandom and politics is also one of the largest youth movements in the world. Yet they remain unknown: an anti-establishment force that is transforming both football and politics. In this book, James Montague goes underground to uncover the true face of this dissident force for the first time.   1312: Among the Ultras tells the story of how the movement began and how it grew to become the global phenomenon that now dominates the stadiums from the Balkans and Buenos Aires. With unprecedented insider access, the book investigates how ultras have grown into a fiercely political movement, embracing extremes on both the left and right; fighting against the commercialisation of football and society - and against the attempts to control them by the authorities, who both covet and fear their power.",

Lionised in his own day for his victory at Agincourt, his piety and his rigorous application of justice, he was elevated by Shakespeare into a champion of English nationalism for all future generations. But what was he really like? Does he deserve to be thought of as 'the greatest man who ever ruled England?'  In Ian Mortimer's groundbreaking book, he portrays Henry in the pivotal year of his reign. Recording the dramatic events of 1415, he offers the fullest, most precise and least romanticised view we have of Henry and what he did.   The result is not only a fascinating reappraisal of Henry; it brings to the fore many unpalatable truths which biographers and military historians have largely ignored. At the centre of the book is the campaign which culminated in the battle of Agincourt: a slaughter ground designed not to advance England's interests directly but to demonstrate God's approval of Henry's royal authority on both sides of the Channel.",

        "summary": "The 1619 Project by Nikole Hannah-Jones#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER A dramatic expansion of a groundbreaking work of journalism, The 1619 Project: A New American Origin Story offers a profoundly revealing vision of the American past and present.  ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR: The Washington Post, NPR, Esquire, Marie Claire, Electric Lit, Ms. magazine, Kirkus Reviews, Booklist  In late August 1619, a ship arrived in the British colony of Virginia bearing a cargo of twenty to thirty enslaved people from Africa. Their arrival led to the barbaric and unprecedented system of American chattel slavery that would last for the next 250 years. This is sometimes referred to as the country's original sin, but it is more than that: It is the source of so much that still defines the United States.  The New York Times Magazine's award-winning \"1619 Project\" issue reframed our understanding of American history by placing slavery and its continuing legacy at the center of our national narrative. This new book substantially expands on that work, weaving together eighteen essays that explore the legacy of slavery in present-day America with thirty-six poems and works of fiction that illuminate key moments of oppression, struggle, and resistance. The essays show how the inheritance of 1619 reaches into every part of contemporary American society, from politics, music, diet, traffic, and citizenship to capitalism, religion, and our democracy itself.  This is a book that speaks directly to our current moment, contextualizing the systems of race and caste within which we operate today. It reveals long-glossed-over truths around our nation's founding and construction-and the way that the legacy of slavery did not end with emancipation, but continues to shape contemporary American life.

        "summary": "1688 by Steve PincusBased on new archival information, this book upends two hundred years of scholarship on England’s Glorious Revolution to claim that it—not the French Revolution—was the first truly modern revolution   For two hundred years historians have viewed England’s Glorious Revolution of 1688–1689 as an un-revolutionary revolution—bloodless, consensual, aristocratic, and above all, sensible. In this brilliant new interpretation Steve Pincus refutes this traditional view.  By expanding the interpretive lens to include a broader geographical and chronological frame, Pincus demonstrates that England’s revolution was a European event, that it took place over a number of years, not months, and that it had repercussions in India, North America, the West Indies, and throughout continental Europe. His rich historical narrative, based on masses of new archival research, traces the transformation of English foreign policy, religious culture, and political economy that, he argues, was the intended consequence of the revolutionaries of 1688–1689.  James II developed a modernization program that emphasized centralized control, repression of dissidents, and territorial empire. The revolutionaries, by contrast, took advantage of the new economic possibilities to create a bureaucratic but participatory state. The postrevolutionary English state emphasized its ideological break with the past and envisioned itself as continuing to evolve. All of this, argues Pincus, makes the Glorious Revolution—not the French Revolution—the first truly modern revolution. This wide-ranging book reenvisions the nature of the Glorious Revolution and of revolutions in general, the causes and consequences of commercialization, the nature of liberalism, and ultimately the origins and contours of modernity itself.",

Finn  'A thrilling, unnerving, clever and beautiful story. Reading it is like giving a little gift to oneself' Fredrik Backman  The year is 1793, Stockholm. King Gustav of Sweden has been assassinated, years of foreign wars have emptied the treasuries, and the realm is governed by a self-interested elite, leaving its citizens to suffer. On the streets, malcontent and paranoia abound.  A body is found in the city's swamp by a watchman, Mickel Cardell, and the case is handed over to investigator Cecil Winge, who is dying of consumption. Together, Winge and Cardell become embroiled in a brutal world of guttersnipes and thieves, mercenaries and madams, and one death will expose a city rotten with corruption beneath its powdered and painted veneer.  The Wolf and the Watchman depicts the capacity for cruelty in the name of survival or greed - but also the capacity for love, friendship, and the desire for a better world.  'An unexpected masterpiece, a wild and unusual mix of genres that in one fell swoop succeeds in renewing the entire crime fiction genre' Arne Dahl",

In 1812 the most powerful man in the world assembled the largest army in history and marched on Moscow with the intention of consolidating his dominion. But within months, Napoleon’s invasion of Russia – history’s first example of total war – had turned into an epic military disaster. Over 400,000 French and Allied troops perished and Napoleon was forced to retreat.             Adam Zamoyski’s masterful work draws on the harrowing first-hand accounts of soldiers and civilians on both sides of the conflict. The result takes the reader beyond the invasion of Russia to present both a poignant tale of the individual foot soldier and a sweeping history of a turbulent time.",

Revisiting the winning formula of diaries and memoirs, and above all original photographs taken on illegally-held cameras by the soldiers themselves, Richard tells the story of 1918, of both the ferocious spring offensive that so nearly brought victory for the Germans in the West, and the tenacious British rearguard fight that thwarted them. The book also tells the vivid story of the Allied breakthrough and the return to open warfare that was to bring victory in November 1918. His previous books, The Road to Passchendaele and The Somme have sold over 30,000 copies in hardback and softback, proving that the public appetite is undiminished for new, original stories illustrated with over 150 rarely or never-before-seen battlefield images.The author has an outstanding collection of over 5,000 privately-taken and overwhelmingly unpublished photographs, revealing the war as it was seen by the men involved, an existence that was sometimes exhilarating, too often terrifying, and occasionally even fun.This book will be published in 2018, in time for the 100th anniversary of the Armistice and the national commemorations that will mark the end of the four-year-long series of centennial events to mark the Great War.",

The Second World War at sea began badly for the Allies. On the day that war was declared, the unarmed passenger liner Athenia was sunk off Rockall, creating an uproar on both sides of the Atlantic. The same month saw the loss of HMS Courageous, a badly needed aircraft carrier, as well as the daring raid by Gunther Prien's U-49 on HMS Royal Oak while she was berthed in the supposedly safe anchorage of Scapa Flow during October. In the meantime, German commerce raiders were creating havoc in the South Atlantic.

The first period was dominated by World War II, when rationing affected the design of clothes for men and women. In 1947 Christian Dior's New Look brought a romantic revival: narrow, rounded shoulders, lightly padded hips and voluminous, billowing skirts introduced a new era of feminity and extravagence. This book is part of a series charting the development of women's and men's clothing from 1900 onwards. It includes complete descriptions of each garment and accessories, itemizing colour, cut, necklines, lapels, sleeves, pockets, fastenings, buttons and belts. The year-by-year format progresses through day wear, evening wear, sportswear, leisurewear, underwear, negligee and wedding wear.

        "summary": "1983 by Taylor Downing'A carefully researched and hugely readable account of the build-up to war, the momentum inexorably growing as he assembles each part of the jigsaw. Indeed, his narrative is so persuasive that by the time you are about two- thirds through, it takes some effort to remind yourself that the Third World War never happened' Dominic Sandbrook, Sunday Times    1983 was a supremely dangerous year - even more dangerous than 1962, the year of the Cuban Missile Crisis. In the US, President Reagan massively increased defence spending, described the Soviet Union as an 'evil empire' and announced his 'Star Wars' programme, calling for a shield in space to defend the US from incoming missiles.    Yuri Andropov, the paranoid Soviet leader, saw all this as signs of American aggression and convinced himself that the US really meant to attack the Soviet Union. He put the KGB on alert to look for signs of an imminent nuclear attack. When a Soviet fighter jet shot down Korean Air Lines flight KAL 007 after straying off course over a sensitive Soviet military area, President Reagan described it as a 'terrorist act' and 'a crime against humanity'. The temperature was rising fast.    Then at the height of the tension, NATO began a war game called Able Archer 83. In this exercise, NATO requested permission to use the codes to launch nuclear weapons. The nervous Soviets convinced themselves this was no exercise but the real thing.    This is an extraordinary and largely unknown Cold War story of spies and double agents, of missiles being readied, of intelligence failures, misunderstandings and the panic of world leaders. With access to hundreds of extraordinary new documents just released in the US, Taylor Downing is able to tell for the first time the gripping but true story of how near the world came to the brink of nuclear war in 1983.     1983: THE WORLD AT THE BRINK is a real-life thriller.",

Guss is the gripping narrative of an intrepid Scottish soldier's audacious defiance and resilience in the face of overwhelming odds.  ‘The greatest serial escaper of the Second World War’ – The Times 'Endlessly fascinating. Cram's story sizzles with adventure' – Giles Milton, Sunday Times  In November 1941 Lt Alastair Cram was taken prisoner in North Africa as a devastating tank battle unfolded as Operation Crusader struggled to relieve Tobruk. His capture began a four year-long odyssey as he passed through twelve different POW camps, three Gestapo prisons and one asylum. Determined to regain his freedom, he became a serial escapee fleeing his captors no fewer than twenty-one times.  In a saga of relentless determination, Cram, along the legendary founder of the SAS, David Stirling, masterminded the audacious 'Cistern Tunnel' escape from the Italian fortress Gavi - a thousand-year-old stronghold housing the most 'dangerous' escape risk prisoners. It became one of the most audacious – but little-known – mass escape attempts of the entire war. Thrillingly told, this is a record of stamina and courage against unfathomable adversity.

        "summary": "24/7 by Jonathan Crary24/7: Late Capitalism and the Ends of Sleep explores some of the ruinous consequences of the expanding non-stop processes of twenty-first-century capitalism. The marketplace now operates through every hour of the clock, pushing us into constant activity and eroding forms of community and political expression, damaging the fabric of everyday life.  Jonathan Crary examines how this interminable non-time blurs any separation between an intensified, ubiquitous consumerism and emerging strategies of control and surveillance. He describes the ongoing management of individual attentiveness and the impairment of perception within the compulsory routines of contemporary technological culture. At the same time, he shows that human sleep, as a restorative withdrawal that is intrinsically incompatible with 24/7 capitalism, points to other more formidable and collective refusals of world-destroying patterns of growth and accumulation.",

        "summary": "24 Hours at Balaclava: 25 October 1854 by Robert KershawIn 1854 Britain and France were at war to save ‘poor little Turkey’, the crumbling Ottoman Empire, from the menace of Russian expansionism. On 25 October they were nine days into what would become an eleven-month siege, with little to show for it. Suddenly, from behind them came the unmistakeable sound of cannon. The Russians had arrived. Vastly outnumbered, the British gained an unlikely upper hand with the charge of the Heavy Brigade and the efforts of the Thin Red Line. But then, within two hours of achieving near victory, the British squandered it in dramatic style with the charge of the Light Brigade. Using eyewitness accounts, letters and diaries, acclaimed military historian Robert Kershaw presents a new, intimate look at the Battle of Balaclava, from the perspective of the men who ‘saw little and knew even less’. Come down from the Heights and see the real story of one of the most ill-fated military expeditions in British history.",

Moore shows that in the Technology Adoption Life Cycle--which begins with innovators and moves to early adopters, early majority, late majority, and laggards--there is a vast chasm between the early adopters and the early majority. While early adopters are willing to sacrifice for the advantage of being first, the early majority waits until they know that the technology actually offers improvements in productivity. The challenge for innovators and marketers is to narrow this chasm and ultimately accelerate adoption across every segment.This third edition brings Moore's classic work up to date with dozens of new examples of successes and failures, new strategies for marketing in the digital world, and Moore's most current insights and findings.

Aligning the organization's work teams with your most important objectives is a never-ending battle. In addition, keeping teams engaged and focused on the top goals is critical. Imagine an organization where every team--from senior leadership to the front line--is focused on the most important priorities and committed to achieving the Wildly Important Goals.FranklinCovey has studied the topic of execution for several years in thousands of teams and in hundreds of organizations. Our research shows that execution breaks down in four ways:1. People and teams don't know the goals. Either there are too many goals or the goals aren't clear.2. People and teams don't know what to do to achieve the goals. The goals are not translated into day-to-day activities.3. People and teams don't keep score. Few can tell at any moment if they are on track to achieve the organization's critical goals.4. People and teams are not held accountable. For results, employees need relevant and timely feedback and regular accountability.The 4 Disciplines of Executionwill help you eliminate these breakdowns.",

Barnum.Some laws teach the need for prudence (Law 1: Never Outshine the Master), others teach the value of confidence (Law 28: Enter Action with Boldness), and many recommend absolute self-preservation (Law 15: Crush Your Enemy Totally). Every law, though, has one thing in common: an interest in total domination. In a bold and arresting two-color package,The 48 Laws of Poweris ideal whether your aim is conquest, self-defense, or simply to understand the rules of the game.",

        "summary": "4th of July by James PattersonDetective Lindsay Boxer and the Women's Murder Club make a courageous return for their fourth and most chilling case ever-one that could easily be their last. In a late-night showdown after a near-fatal car chase, San Francisco police lieutenant Lindsay Boxer has to make an instantaneous decision: in self-defense, she fires her weapon-and sets off a chain of events that leaves a police force disgraced, an entire city divided, and a family destroyed. Now everything she's worked her entire life for hinges on the decision of twelve jurors. To escape scrutiny during breaks from her trial, Lindsay retreats to the picturesque town of Half Moon Bay. But soon after her arrival, a string of grisly murders punches through the peaceful community. There are no witnesses and there is no discernible pattern. But a key detail recalls a case Lindsay worked on as a rookie years before-an unsolved murder that has haunted her ever since. As summer comes into full swing, Lindsay and her friends in the Women's Murder Club battle for her life on two fronts: before a judge and jury as her trial comes to a climax, and facing unknown adversaries who will do anything to keep her from the truth about the killings-including killing again. James Patterson fine-tunes the tension as never before in this breathtaking addition to the best-selling detective series to debut in a decade.",

Connected both to old wisdom and new scientific frontiers of discovery' Lauren Laverne ________________________  'We can all learn something from 52 Ways to Walk. I know I can.' Michael Ball, BBC Radio 2 ________________________  Walking strengthens our bodies, calms our minds and lifts our spirits. But it does so much more than this. Our vision, hearing, respiration, sleep, cognition, memory, blood pressure, sense of smell and balance are all enhanced by how we walk. For instance:   · Walking in cold weather burns extra fat and builds more muscle. · Walking alone strengthens our memories. · Walking in woodland helps us sleep. · And there’s nothing more restorative than a romantic nighthike.  Our choice of location, time, direction, duration, walking companion and gait, as well as the weather we opt to walk in, can transform our daily stroll. Here, Annabel Streets shares the thrill of 52 different ways to walk, explaining the latest science behind each one, and providing practical tips for making the most of your daily steps.  52 Ways to Walk is a revelatory and informative handbook for anyone stuck in a walking rut, curious about the lesser-known benefits of walking or merely in need of some on-foot novelty and adventure.",

A bejewelled mosaic\" Financial Times  \"Humane, insightful and deeply cultured\" Times Literary Supplement  Though a tireless explorer of distant cultures, for more than forty years Cees Nooteboom has also been returning to Menorca, \"the island of the wind\", and it is in his house there, with a study full of books and a garden taken over by cacti and many insects, that the 533 days of writing take place.    The result is not a diary, nor a set of movements of the soul organised by dates, but \"a book of days\", with observations about what is immediately around him, his love for Menorca, his thoughts on the world, on life and death, on literature and oblivion. Every impression opens windows onto vast horizons: the Divine Comedy and the books it generated, the contempt of Borges for Gombrowicz, the death of David Bowie, the endless flight of the Voyagers, the repetition of history as a tragedy, but never as farce.    533 is a meditative rhapsody that would like to exclude the noise of current events, yet must return to them several times, and sceptically contemplates the threat of a disintegrating Europe. Reading this book is like having an extraordinary conversation with an extraordinary mind.  \"The very first pages are so powerful that you suspect the author must have binned the preceding pages that were needed to climb to such heights\" De Volkskrant  \"The 533 days captivate in their undisguised openness to the world\" Süddeutsche Zeitung    Photographs by Simone Sassen * Translated from the Dutch by Laura Watkinson",

Shortly after the South African Police Services receive this threatening email, a policeman is shot by a sniper and recovering alcoholic Benny Griessel is ordered to reopen the Sloet case.  Hanneke Sloet was a sensual and ambitious lawyer. At the time of her murder she was working on one of the biggest Black Empowerment deals in South African history. She was found dead in her luxury Cape Town apartment, a single stab wound to her chest.  After forty days, the trail has gone cold. The first investigation could find no motive and no leads, only a set of nude photographs, an ex-boyfriend with a rock-solid alibi, conniving attorneys and financial double-dealing.  Benny has to deal with immense pressure from his superiors, the media and the unfathomable sniper, whose emails keep coming and who won't stop shooting. And then there's Benny's love interest, former pop sensation Alexa Barnard, who is also trying to rebuild her life after the ravages of alcohol, and Benny has to make sure she stays sober for her comeback.  At the same time, Benny's feisty colleague, Captain Mbali Kaleni, is hunting the shooter, trying desperately to find what connects him to Hanneke Sloet.  Both Benny and Mbali are about to endure seven days of hell.",

It reminded her of home and gave her the strength to keep fighting.Now, years later, Amanda is struggling to live normally. Her friends have gone on to college, while she battles PTSD. She's not getting any better, and she fears that if something doesn't change soon she never will.Six years ago, Chase Henry defied astronomical odds, won a coveted role on a new TV show, and was elevated to super-stardom.

She works at Get Nailed, the beauty salon here in town. Well, Teri got married a little while ago--to Bobby Polgar, the famous chess champion. They've moved into a beautiful house, 74 Seaside Avenue, which has a spectacular view of Puget Sound. Teri's my hairdresser, and she confided that something seems to be worrying Bobby. When she asked him about it, he told her he was protecting his queen, and she got the oddest feeling that he wasn't talking about chess, but about her. Rachel Pendergast also works at Get Nailed, and I've heard that she has two men seriously interested in her. I also wanted to tell you that Linnette McAfee, who's Roy and Corrie's daughter, recently left town because her love life fell apart. We all know about that kind of trouble.

        "summary": "77 Shadow Street (with bonus novella The Moonlit Mind) by Dean KoontzThe Pendleton stands on the summit of Shadow Hill at the highest point of an old heartland city, a Gilded Age palace built in the late 1800s as a tycoon s dream home. Almost from the beginning, its grandeur has been scarred by episodes of madness, suicide, mass murder, and whispers of things far worse. But since its rechristening in the 1970s as a luxury apartment building, the Pendleton has been at peace. For its fortunate residents a successful songwriter and her young son, a disgraced ex-senator, a widowed attorney, and a driven money manager among them the Pendleton s magnificent quarters are a sanctuary, its dark past all but forgotten. But now inexplicable shadows caper across walls, security cameras relay impossible images, phantom voices mutter in strange tongues, not-quite-human figures lurk in the basement, elevators plunge into unknown depths. With each passing hour, a terrifying certainty grows: Whatever drove the Pendleton s past occupants to their unspeakable fates is at work again. Soon, all those within its boundaries will be engulfed by a deadly tide from which few have escaped. Dean Koontz transcends all expectations as he takes readers on a gripping journey to a place where nightmare visions become real and where a group of singular individuals hold the key to humanity s destiny. Welcome to 77 Shadow Street. Praise for the narration of 77 Shadow Street by Dean Koontz, performed by Peter Berkrot: Narrator Peter Berkrot opens the creaking door and invites listeners inside with a gentle, unassuming voice. Ignore that dark thing you saw out of the corner of your eye it s just a trick of the light. Berkrot performs with skill and assurance as strange voices, eerie sights, and inexplicable things take over the posh mansion. (c) AudioFile 2012, Portland, Maine",

Emily Flemming is afraid that her husband, Dave, might be having an affair. She apparently found an earring in his pocket--and it wasn't hers. And she says he's been coming home late and acting secretive. Not only that, some jewelry was recently stolen from an old woman, and Dave (in his capacity as pastor) used to visit her a lot. This is all so hard to believe  Dave's a good pastor and a good man. He and Emily appear to have the perfect life, with their children, Matthew and Mark, and their lovely home at 8 Sandpiper Way. But I guess things aren't always as they seem. Reader, I'd love to hear what you think, and so does Emily. I have some personal news, too--it's turning out to be a challenging year. But there are also some interesting updates about our friends in Cedar Cove. Like Sheriff Troy Davis, to mention one. Guess what?

He was hoping to marry his onetime girlfriend, Faith Beckwith, who recently moved back to town. Well, the latest is that Faith ended the relationship last month, even though both of them are widowed and available. According to Troy, there were a few misunderstandings between them--some inadvertently caused, it seems, by his daughter, Megan. Troy's got plenty to keep him occupied, though--like the unidentified remains found in a cave outside town. And the break-ins at 204 Rosewood Lane, the house Faith just happens to be renting from Grace Harding. All of that's a distraction from what's happening in my life. I'm going through chemo right now, and I'm so grateful for my husband, Jack, my family and my friends, who give me the strength and support I need to beat this. But beat it I will  I'd suggest meeting at Troy's place, 92 Pacific Boulevard, so we can all talk, but the Pancake Palace is probably a better choice if you want a decent cup of coffee  Olivia",

In addition, over 950 clearly detailed illustrations depict stitches, weaves, laces, garments, collars, shoes, jewelry, hair styles, and other sartorial features.This is the perfect reference for increasing fashion vocabularies, injecting a stimulating term or phrase in conversations about wearing apparel, or making articles written about clothing more understandable.

Having built a gargantuan and loyal social media following while establishing a successful stand-up career-all after a couple of decades of dubious behavior-Steve-O is proof that anyone can find meaning and fulfillment in life, no matter what path they choose. Packed with self-deprecating wit and gruelingly earned wisdom, A Hard Kick in the Nuts will reverberate with readers everywhere who have lived a lot (sometimes too much) and are now wondering how to approach the years to come.

Each contains a question, a Bible passage, a Bible verse, a discussion, something to consider, recommended further reading and a prayer.      These answers may lead to more questions which is fine – but the main aim of this book is that you, the reader, come to see and know better the One who is the Answer, Jesus Christ.",

Here the reader will meet forgers, poets, aristocrats, politicians and some less likely residents of the county, including Spring-Heeled Jack – whose spectral figure reportedly jumped over Newport Arch – and the appearance of an angel in Gainsborough. There has always been much more to Lincolnshire than farm lands and sea-side towns: this is the county that brought us Lord Tennyson (whose brother was treated at an experimental asylum in the area), John Wesley and, in contrast, William Marwood, the notorious hangman; here too were found the Dam Busters, the first tanks and the fishing fleets of Grimsby. All may be found within the pages of this book, bound to delight residents and visitors alike.",

A great storyteller hitting his stride' – Lee Child, author of the Jack Reacher series A century-old mystery - and a desperate battle to survive. Abandon is a compulsive standalone thriller from Blake Crouch, the New York Times bestselling author of Dark Matter and Recursion.. . .On Christmas Day in 1893, every man, woman, and child in a remote mining town disappeared, belongings forsaken, meals left to freeze in vacant cabins, and not a single bone found.  Now, journalist Abigail Foster and her father, a historian, have set out unocver the truth. Exploring the area, they are joined by two backcountry guides: a psychic and a paranormal photographer. The long-abandoned town is, according to rumour, haunted.  But Abigail and her companions are about to learn that the town’s ghosts are the least of their worries. Twenty miles from civilization, with a blizzard bearing down, they realize they are not alone.  The ordeal that follows will test this small team past the breaking point as they battle the elements and human foes alike and discover that the town’s secrets still have the power to kill.  Part journey into old-West history, part nail-biting survival thriller, Abandon is a bloody, darkly surprising tale as only Blake Crouch could deliver.  * * *  'Written with the breathless grace of a Western sunset, Abandon is more than a nonstop thriller - it's a riveting morality tale that will haunt you well past the final pages' – Marcus Sakey, author of The Brilliance Trilogy   'Abandon is not merely an exciting thriller with a terrific plot and gangbuster ending; the writing here sings; the characters live and the universal themes of greed and evil resonate long after the final sentence' – John Lescroart, author of The Missing Piece",

But this vast metropolis of more than 10 million people hides many secrets and unexpected treasures from the city’s unique 2000-year history.  In Abandoned London, read about the Abbey Mills Pumping Station, a facility created in 1858 to deal with ‘the Great Stink’, and now London’s Italian-Gothic cathedral of sewage; or the subterranean Finsbury Park underground reservoir, a space capable of holding five million gallons of water and today used as an occasional movie location; or the remnants of Highgate’s overground steam railway station, now a protected bat habitat; or the Clapham deep-level shelters, constructed in World War II and designed to provide protection for locals against aerial bombing raids; or the Haggerston public baths, part of an early 20th century building programme devised to improve London’s hygiene.  These photographs of abandoned places capture a moment in time. Some of the buildings have since been demolished or refurbished,  but many are still there, neglected and uncared for. These places have great value and a rich significance, offering us a glimpse of past worlds.",

Abbey Road is mythical' Nile Rodgers  Many people will recognise the famous zebra crossing. Some visitors may have graffitied their name on its hallowed outer walls. Others might even have managed to penetrate the iron gates. But what draws in these thousands of fans here, year after year? What is it that really happens behind the doors of the most celebrated recording studio in the world?  It may have begun life as an affluent suburban house, but it soon became a creative hub renowned around the world as a place where great music, ground-breaking sounds and unforgettable tunes were forged - nothing less than a witness to, and a key participant in, the history of popular music itself.  What has been going on there for over ninety years has called for skills that are musical, creative, technical, mechanical, interpersonal, logistical, managerial, chemical and, romantics might be tempted add, close to magic.  This is for the people who believe in the magic.",

The procedures set in motion by Alexander II undid the ties that bound together 22 million serfs and 100,000 noble estate owners, and changed the face of Russia. Rather than presenting abolition as an 'event' that happened in February 1861, The Abolition of Serfdom in Russia presents the reform as a process. It traces the origins of the abolition of serfdom back to reforms in related areas in 1762 and forward to the culmination of the process in 1907. Written in an engaging and accessible manner, the book shows how the reform process linked the old social, economic and political order of eighteenth-century Russia with the radical transformations of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries that culminated in revolution in 1917.",

From Arnhem Land and the desert, the Kimberley and northern Queensland, to modern towns and cities, Aboriginal artists have built on traditions that stretch back at least 50,000 years, working in a variety of contexts from the sacred and secret realm of ceremony to more public spheres. Work across all media is included, from painting, sculpture, engraving, constructions and weaving to the most recent work in photography, printmaking and textile design. The story of Aboriginal art is brought into the 21st century in this revised and expanded third edition with a new chapter that maps the latest developments across each of Australia’s geographical regions. Updated information and more than twenty-five new illustrations highlight, among other things, the impact of urban living, the growth of local art centres which support the work of indigenous artists, and the rise of women artists – all testifying to Aboriginal art’s continued dynamism and vitality.",

She’s mostly steered clear of family life since the death of her younger brother. That is until the day she hears her mother, Diana, has been found floating face down in their swimming pool.   Diana, as Director of the Center for Reproductive Choice, was a national figure who inspired passions and made enemies. Detective Huck Berlin is brought in to investigate the case when it becomes clear that Diana was murdered. Several people have quarrelled with Diana on that fateful day, not least Frank, her husband of twenty years, and her wayward child. Now father and daughter are thrown together in an unexpected twist of family life.

        "summary": "About Time by Paul DaviesIn About Time: Einstein's Unfinished Revolution Paul Davies confronts the puzzles and paradoxes of time that have bemused the world's greatest thinkers throughout the ages.  When Albert Einstein formulated his theory of relativity it brought about a revolution in our understanding of time, yet also presented a new set of mysteries. Einstein's time can be warped, leading to bizarre possibilities such as black holes and time travel, while making a nonsense of our perception of a 'now' or a division of time into past, present and future.  In About Time Paul Davies tackles the tough questions about time, including the strange relationship between physical time and our psychological perception of it. He gives straightforward descriptions of topics such as the theory of relativity, the relation between time dilation and the speed of light and Hawking's 'imaginary time'. He concludes that, despite decades of progress in unravelling the mysteries of time, the revolution is still underway...

        "summary": "Above Suspicion by Lynda La PlanteInstead of Jane Tennison immortalised by Helen Mirren in PRIME SUSPECT, think Anna Travis in ABOVE SUSPICION, Lynda's wonderful new creation of a female detective for today. A rookie detective, Anna is about to embark on her first murder case - and it couldn't be a more serious, more gruesome series of murders. The killings began eight years before; now the body count is up to six. The method of killing is identical, the backgrounds of the girls very similar - all of them prostitutes. As the book opens, a seventh body is found, same modus operandi but the victim this time is a young student, sweet, innocent, with 'the face of an angel'. Anna stumbles on a vital piece of information which links one man to the killings. But that man is a household name, a well-known and much-loved actor, with charm, good looks and the gift of the gab. Denial springs easily and confidently to his lips; his protestation of innocence is convincing. What if he is arrested, in the face of huge publicity, and he is the wrong man? This is Lynda La Plante at her best, creating a compelling, charismatic new detective in Anna Travis, and bringing to vivid life on the page a completely gripping crime thriller,",

        "summary": "The Absence of Myth by Georges BatailleFor Bataille, the absence of myth had itself become the myth of the modern age. In a world that had lost the secret of its cohesion, Bataille saw surrealism as both a symptom and a beginning of an attempt to address this loss. His writings on this theme are the result of a profound reflection in the wake of World War Two. The Absence of Myth is the most incisive study yet made of surrealism, insisting on its importance as a cultural and social phenomenon with far-reaching consequences. Clarifying Bataille's links with the surrealist movement, and throwing revealing light on his complex and greatly misunderstood relationship with Andre Breton, The Absence of Myth shows Bataille to be a much more radical figure than his postmodernist devotees would have us believe: a man who continually tried to extend Marxist social theory; a pessimistic thinker, but one as far removed from nihilism as can be.",

The Carls just appeared. Coming home from work at three a.m., twenty-three-year-old April May stumbles across a giant sculpture. Delighted by its appearance and craftsmanship - like a ten-foot-tall Transformer wearing a suit of samurai armour - April and her friend Andy make a video with it, which Andy uploads to YouTube. The next day April wakes up to a viral video and a new life. News quickly spreads that there are Carls in dozens of cities around the world, and April, as their first documentarian, finds herself at the centre of an intense international media spotlight.   Now April has to deal with the pressure on her relationships, her identity and her safety that this new position brings, all while being on the front lines of the quest to find out not just what the Carls are, but what they want from us.  Compulsively entertaining and powerfully relevant, An Absolutely Remarkable Thing grapples with big themes, including how the social internet is changing fame, how our culture deals with fear, and how vilification and adoration follows a life in the public eye.",

This bold, contrarian view, backed up by exhaustive research, introduces our near-term future, where exponentially growing technologies and three other powerful forces are conspiring to better the lives of billions. An antidote to pessimism by tech entrepreneur turned philanthropist, Peter H. Diamandis and award-winning science writer Steven Kotler.   Since the dawn of humanity, a privileged few have lived in stark contrast to the hardscrabble majority. Conventional wisdom says this gap cannot be closed. But it is closing-fast. The authors document how four forces-exponential technologies, the DIY innovator, the Technophilanthropist, and the Rising Billion-are conspiring to solve our biggest problems. Abundance establishes hard targets for change and lays out a strategic roadmap for governments, industry and entrepreneurs, giving us plenty of reason for optimism.   Examining human need by category-water, food, energy, healthcare, education, freedom-Diamandis and Kotler introduce dozens of innovators making great strides in each area: Larry Page, Steven Hawking, Dean Kamen, Daniel Kahneman, Elon Musk, Bill Joy, Stewart Brand, Jeff Skoll, Ray Kurzweil, Ratan Tata, Craig Venter, among many, many others.",

        "summary": "Abyss by Max HastingsA Times History Book of the Year 2022                      From the #1 bestselling historian Max Hastings ‘the heart-stopping story of the missile crisis’ Daily Telegraph                         The 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis was the most perilous event in history, when mankind faced a looming nuclear collision between the United States and Soviet Union. During those weeks, the world gazed into the abyss of potential annihilation.                        Max Hastings’s graphic new history tells the story from the viewpoints of national leaders, Russian officers, Cuban peasants, American pilots and British disarmers. Max Hastings deploys his accustomed blend of eye-witness interviews, archive documents and diaries, White House tape recordings, top-down analysis, first to paint word-portraits of the Cold War experiences of Fidel Castro’s Cuba, Nikita Khrushchev’s Russia and Kennedy’s America; then to describe the nail-biting Thirteen Days in which Armageddon beckoned.             Hastings began researching this book believing that he was exploring a past event from twentieth century history. He is as shocked as are millions of us around the world, to discover that the rape of Ukraine gives this narrative a hitherto unimaginable twenty-first century immediacy. We may be witnessing the onset of a new Cold War between nuclear-armed superpowers.             To contend with today’s threat, which Hastings fears will prove enduring, it is critical to understand how, sixty years ago, the world survived its last glimpse into the abyss. Only by fearing the worst, he argues, can our leaders hope to secure the survival of the planet.",

InAcceptable Risk, he confronts one of the most provocative issues of our time: personality-altering drugs and the complex moral questions they raise. Neuroscientist Edward Armstrong has managed to isolate a psychotropic drug with a strange and dark history--one that may account for the public hysteria during the Salem witch trials. In a brilliant designer-drug transformation, it is developed into an antidepressant with truly startling therapeutic capabilities. But who can be sure the drug is safe for consumers? Who defines the boundaries of normal human behavior? And if the drug's side effects are proven to be dangerous--even terrifying--how far will the medical community go to alter their standards of.Acceptable Risk.",

Access All Areas is a personal, insightful and humorous memoir packed with stories of being on the cultural frontline, from first writing press releases on a typewriter driven by Tip Ex, then as a press officer for heavy metal bands taking the bus up to Donnington Festival with coffee, croissants and the much more popular sulfate. To taking on Madonna, an unknown girl from Detroit, and telling Smash Hits 'you don't have to run the piece if the single doesn't chart', and becoming a true pioneer in music, Charone continues to work with the biggest names in music, including Depeche Mode, Robert Plant, Foo Fighters and Mark Ronson at her agency MBCPR.  The story of how a music-loving, budding journalist from a Chicago suburb became the defining music publicist of her generation, Access All Areas is a time capsule of the last fifty years, told through the lens of music.",

They told him that only 29.5% of the United Kingdom's population is made up of white, heterosexual, able-bodied men; so, he wonders, why do they still make up the vast majority of people we see in our media?  Joining forces with the former Chair of the Royal Television Society's Diversity Committee Marcus Ryder, he draws on decades of experience to reveal why recent efforts to diversify media have been thus far ineffective, and why they are simply not enough. With wit, humour and unflinching gravitas they analyse the flaws of current diversity initiatives, point out the structural and financial imbalances working against the cause, and provide clear solutions to get the media industry back on track.  Access All Areas is an urgent, actionable manifesto that will dramatically shift the debate around diversity and the media.",

        "summary": "Access EAP Frameworks Teacher's Book by Sue ArgentAccess EAP: Frameworks Access EAP: Frameworks is nominated for the Excellence in Course Innovation award at the 2014 ELTons. Written by the authors of the highly successful EAP Essentials, the second part of this two-level course teaches academic language and competence to Upper Intermediate to Advanced learners. Access EAP: Frameworks is designed for students who are about to enter higher education studies in an English-speaking institution. The course is based on real student life and prepares students for the tasks they will face when studying in an English-medium higher education institution. The reader follows students at university as they have discussions, listen to lectures, read texts, work on assignments and make choices about how to study. The book builds language and competence across key academic themes such as academic integrity, argument and research, applying the concept of Graduate Attributes - skills, personal qualities and understanding that are developed through the higher education experience - to frame activities and tasks. The book has ten units, each framed around a key academic theme.  Within each unit, the first section introduces the theme and subsequent sections develop the associated concepts, language and competence further or in a different context.  The units are free standing, but within them the language skills and study competence are integrated, reflecting the reality of academic study. Key academic words are listed by the texts in which they are presented, and regular tasks help understanding, support learning and practise using these key words. Students will learn the important language and grammar patterns needed for understanding and producing academic texts. They will also discover essential aspects of academic study, including the ability to read critically and integrate ideas from sources into essays or reports. See accompanying Course Book.",

        "summary": "The Accidental Social Entrepreneur by Grant SmithThe remarkable story of one gutsy contractor's determination to end poverty in Africa.   Grant Smith is not a visionary or an enthusiastic missionary. He's a problem solver. When confronted with the desperate problems of poverty he witnessed in Africa, he did the only thing he knew how to do--business. Business that would provide jobs and pay people enough so that they would not have to rely on charity to send their kids to school, so that none would be forced to live in a tin shed without water, electricity, sewerage, or dignity, fighting off the threat of pneumonia every time it rained. His venture led to a great challenge: become the biggest house-builder in Kenya.   Both humorous and realistic, Smith tells of his successes and failures with projects as diverse as growing oil crops, a road-building scheme, house building, and selling old gas pumps. With faith in God's provision--and a little bewilderment--Smith wrestles with difficulties that every entrepreneur knows too well: finding investment funding only to lose it again, acquiring trustworthy business partners, confronting bribery and bureaucracy, corruption and culture. He is not the biggest house-builder in Kenya (yet!), but Smith has stumbled on a near-miraculous way of unlocking long-term financial provision for local Christian charities.   For those who dream of making a difference for communities affected by poverty, this story is inspiring and thought-provoking. It encourages readers to see how ordinary people have been created for a purpose and have the potential to facilitate miracles. The Accidental Social Entrepreneur is a real challenge to consider how we might use the gifts and resources we have been given by God to change lives.",

Mary Stuart had none of the ruthlessness of her contemporary sisters, and the female empowerment of Catherine de Medici, Diane de Poitiers or Elizabeth Tudor passed her by.    In an age of intellectually brilliant and powerful women, Mary relied on her beauty and charm in place of reason and determination. Passively and gracefully, she allowed events to overtake her as accidents and when she did attempt to control her future she unwittingly set in train the events that would lead her to the executioner's block.",

The benefits that accrue go beyond simple revenue numbers, and point to an approach that must be focused not just on greater revenue as the sole arbiter of strategy. When Account Planning is executed well, customer satisfaction increases. Customers who are more satisfied buy more from you, and do so without calling your competitors first. Customers who are served well are easier to retain, and therefore it is easier to make your revenue targets year after year. When you do effective Account Planning, you get to understand the customer's business, sit with them at their side of the table, and strengthen your ability to shape their thinking and their business strategies. A happy customer is hostile territory for your competitor to enter. Switching suppliers is expensive for a customer and they will do so only if they feel you are not serving them well and fairly. Your ability to monitor, measure and react is greater if you are closer to the heart of their business, understanding their corporate goals, and motivations.  It takes investment, research and hard work, but is the price of customer retention and growth. In ACCOUNT PLANNING in SALESFORCE, you will learn how to gather the information you need to understand the Account as a marketplace and to segment that marketplace into discrete units so that you can choose where to spend your time. Recording the Current Opportunities in the Account, as well as business you already have won, you will be able to place your solutions on a structured map of the customer's business. Exploring how to uncover the customer's Business Drivers and how to navigate the political landscape in the account will help you to understand both the people who matter  -  the Key Players  -  and their associated Business Drivers. When all of the opportunities in the Account have been identified, you will evaluate each one against the twin axes of Value to Customer and Value to Us. That way you will uncover areas of Mutual Value  -  which is a thread that you will find woven into the fabric of the methodology. It is important.  This is the White Space in the Account where you can help your customer to identify new potential areas of opportunity  -  and simultaneously discover new areas of opportunity for yourself. Finally, you will build the Execution Plan so that you get beyond planning and begin to manage and execute. And to keep things interesting, you will find many musical references throughout the book  -  this will be the only book on Account Planning that you will find that includes a song playlist! ACCOUNT PLANNING in SALESFORCE is focused on helping companies that have purchased Salesforce with their Account Planning initiatives. Its goal is to be the reference text on Account Planning for all Salesforce users.",

        "summary": "Accounting: A Very Short Introduction by Christopher Nobes And At The University Of Sydney)If you read the 'business pages' of a newspaper or if you listen to the financial news on the television or radio, you will often hear terms such as 'liability', 'balance sheet' or 'earnings'. These terms turn up in non-financial contexts as well: 'he was more of a liability than an asset'. If you invest in shares, have a building society account, or sit on a committee of the property company which owns your apartment block, you will receive financial statements every year. If you are a manager in a company, a hospital or a school, you will see accounting information often.   This Very Short Introduction provides a guide to understanding and using accounting information. Christopher Nobes explains the main areas of accounting work, from bookkeeping and financial reporting to auditing and management accounting.   ABOUT THE SERIES: The Very Short Introductions series from Oxford University Press contains hundreds of titles in almost every subject area.

However, the Greenland walrus hunting grounds have experienced marked environmental changes due to climate change, and quotas were introduced for the catch across all of Greenland in 2006.

        "summary": "Acid Dreams by Martin A LeeThe idea for this book came from my decision to update an article by Roy C. McCullough entitled Insurance Rates in the Courts published in the June and July 1961 issues of the Insurance Law Journal. When this project began, the intention was to produce a similar journal article surveying insurance rate litiga- tion between 1960 and the present using basically the same organization followed in the seminal article. However, the volume of reported cases during the last twenty years was much larger than anticipated and the issues being litigated had expanded dramatically. The project grew as my study progressed, and the resulting book surveys more than three hundred disputes involving insurance ratemaking and insurance rate regulation. The fruition of this project would not have been possible without the consistent encouragement and criticism of Roy McCullough, and it is with gratitude that I acknowledge his continuous and valuable assistance to me in this effort. Once an initial draft was prepared, a number of my associates cooperated by reading and commenting on the manuscript. I would like to give special thanks to Michael J. Miller and James F. Perry who unselfishly shared their time and knowledge to improve this work. Needless to say, none of those who read the manuscript is responsible for any errors in concept or detail that may remain.",

When he makes the mistake of getting too close to one of his clients, the wife of a leading Communist Party official, the ageing Lothario fears for his life as a vengeful husband decides to put his house in order.   So when a domestic dispute from the other side of the world leads to a shoot-out in a luxury penthouse apartment in Chelsea, an ex-cop called Marvin Taylor is one of the casualties. Inspector John Carlyle is little more than a casual onlooker until Taylor's widow turns up, looking for answers. The inspector is drawn into the morass of dealing and double-dealing, much to the dismay of his boss, Carole Simpson, who wants him to focus on Barbara Hutton, a Bloomsbury housewife who may - or may not - be a former German terrorist  wanted for a forty-year-old murder...

        "summary": "Adam Smith by Jesse Norman'A superb book' Financial Times, Books of the Year  Adam Smith is now widely regarded as 'the father of modern economics' and the most influential economist who ever lived. But what he really thought, and what the implications of his ideas are, remain fiercely contested. Was he an eloquent advocate of capitalism and the freedom of the individual? Or a prime mover of 'market fundamentalism' and an apologist for inequality and human selfishness? Or something else entirely? Jesse Norman's brilliantly conceived \\book gives us not just Smith's economics, but his vastly wider intellectual project. Against the turbulent backdrop of Enlightenment Scotland, it lays out a succinct and highly engaging account of Smith's life and times, reviews his work as a whole and traces his influence over the past two centuries.  But this book is not only a biography. It dispels the myths and debunks the caricatures that have grown up around Adam Smith. It explores Smith's ideas in detail, from ethics to law to economics and government, and the impact of those ideas on thinkers as diverse as Karl Marx, Charles Darwin, John Maynard Keynes and Friedrich Hayek. Far from being simply an economist, Adam Smith emerges as one of the founders of modern social psychology and behavioural theory. Far from being a doctrinaire 'libertarian' or 'neoliberal' thinker, he offers a strikingly modern evolutionary theory of political economy, which recognises the often complementary roles of markets and the state.  At a time when economics and politics are ever more polarized between left and right, this book, by offering a Smithian analysis of contemporary markets, predatory capitalism and the 2008 financial crash, returns us to first principles and shows how the lost centre of modern public debate can be recreated. Through Smith's work, it addresses crucial issues of inequality, human dignity and exploitation; and it provides a compelling explanation of why he remains central to any attempt to defend, reform or renew the market system.",

        "summary": "The Admiral Benbow by Sam WillisAdmiral John Benbow was an English naval hero, a fighting sailor of ruthless methods but indomitable courage. Benbow was a man to be reckoned with. In 1702, however, when Benbow engaged a French squadron off the Spanish main, other ships in his squadron failed to support him. His leg shattered by a cannon-ball, Benbow fought on - but to no avail: the French escaped and the stricken Benbow succumbed to his wounds. When the story of his 'Last Fight' reached England, there was an outcry. Two of the captains who had abandoned him were court-martialled and shot; 'Brave Benbow' was elevated from national hero to national legend, his valour immortalized in broadsheet and folksong: ships were named after him; Tennyson later feted him in verse; in Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure Island, the tavern where Jim Hawkins and his mother live is called 'The Admiral Benbow'. For the very first time, Sam Willis tells the extraordinary story of Admiral Benbow through an age of dramatic change, from his birth under Cromwell's Commonwealth; to service under the restored Stuart monarchy; to the Glorious Revolution of 1688; to the French wars of Louis XIV; and finally to the bitter betrayal of 1702. The Admiral Benbow covers all aspects of seventeenth century naval life in richly vivid detail, from strategy and tactics to health and discipline. But Benbow also worked in the Royal Dockyards, lived in Samuel Evelyn's House, knew Peter the Great, helped to found the first naval hospital, and helped to build the first offshore lighthouse. The second volume in the Hearts of Oak trilogy, from one of Britain's most exciting young historians, The Admiral Benbow is a gripping and detailed account of the making of a naval legend.",

        "summary": "The Adrenal Thyroid Revolution by Aviva Romm MdA Yale-trained, board-certified family physician with a specialty in women's health and obstetrics delivers a proven 28-day program to heal the overwhelmed, overloaded systems, and prevent and reverse the myriad of symptoms affecting the vast majority of women today.  Weight gain, fatigue, brain fog, hormonal imbalances, and autoimmune conditions-for years, health practitioners have commonly viewed each as individual health problems resulting from a patient's genetic bad luck, poor lifestyle choices, or lack of willpower. Patients, too, have turned to different doctors to alleviate their specific symptoms: an endocrinologist for a thyroid problem; a gynecologist for hormonal issues; an internist for weight, diabetes, and high blood pressure; a rheumatologist for joint problems, and even to therapists or psychologists. While these ailments may seem unrelated, Dr. Aviva Romm contends that they are intrinsically connected by what she calls Survival Overdrive Syndrome, a condition that occurs when the body becomes overloaded. SOS can result from childhood survival patterns or adult life stressors that are compounded by foods we eat, toxins in our environment, viral infections, lack of sleep, disrupted gut microflora, and even prescribed medications. Two of the systems most affected are the adrenal system and the thyroid, which control mood, hormones, inflammation, immunity, energy, weight, will power, blood sugar balance, cholesterol, sleep, and a host of other bodily functions. When these systems become overwhelmed they lead to symptoms that can develop into full blow illnesses, including diabetes, hypertension, osteoporosis, and heart disease-all of which have medically provable origins in SOS. The Adrenal Thyroid Revolution explains SOS, how it impacts our bodies and can lead to illness, and most importantly, offers a drug-free cure developed through Dr. Romm's research and clinical work with tens of thousands of patients. In as little as two weeks, you can lose excess weight, discover increased energy, improve sleep, and feel better. With The Adrenal Thyroid Revolution, you can rescue your metabolism, hormones, mind and mood-and achieve long-lasting health.",

But when he puts his costume on, he is transformed into an ordinary teenage nerd with a costume on.   After years of watching superhero movies, reading comics and fantasizing about being a crime-fighter, he decides to become one.   First of all he needs a superhero name, a superhero costume and some superpowers. Then he needs to find some crime to fight. His diary chronicles his valiant attempts to make the world a better place and, armed with only plastic handcuffs and stink bombs, and stuck with his dependable but incompetent sidekick, Henry, Josh becomes embroiled in a dark world of crime, armed gangs and people illegally parking in disabled spaces.

It asks the big questions, such as: Why would someone want to fight crime? Wouldn’t they get in the way of police (and school) work? Why would a tight-fitting Lycra costume help?  Will Josh rise to the challenge and become a genuine hero? Or will he go home and hide under his bed?",

        "summary": "The Adventures of Pinocchio by Carlo CollodiIn Vietnam, the American government vowed to win the hearts and minds of the people. On the other side, among those who led and sympathized with the insurgents, the term people's war gained a wide currency. Yet while much has been written about those who professed to speak for the Vietnamese population, we know surprisingly little about the everyday life of the peasants who made up the bulk of the country's inhabitants. This book illuminates that subject. Drawing on a wide range of sources, including interviews conducted by the Rand Corporation with informants from My Tho Province in the Mekong Delta, David Hunt brings to light the daily experience of villagers in the midst of war and revolution.The peasants of southern Vietnam were neither onlookers nor mere victims as fighting raged throughout their country. From the concerted uprising in 1959-1960 to the Tet Offensive of 1968, the revolutionary movement they created was in fact the driving force within the war. Known as the Viet Cong to their adversaries, the rebels called themselves the Liberation Front. They demanded an end to landlordism and an egalitarian distribution of the means of subsistence as well as a democratization of relations between town and countryside, parents and children, men and women. They hoped the Vietnamese people would achieve a fuller sense of their place in the world and of the power they possessed to fashion their own destinies, without reliance on supernatural forces.In the first half of the book, Hunt analyzes this cultural revolution. As fighting spread and became more destructive, especially after the U.S. escalation in 1965, villagers were driven from their homes, the rural infrastructure collapsed, and customary notions of space and time lost purchase on an increasingly chaotic world. In the second half of the book, Hunt shows how peasants, who earlier had aspired to a kind of revolutionary modernism, now found themselves struggling to survive and to cope with the American intruders who poured into My Tho, and how they managed to regroup and spearhead the Tet Offensive that irrevocably altered the course of the war.",

Mischievous and full of energy, Tom enjoys childish pranks and pastimes with his friends, Huck Finn, the town outcast and Joe Harper, his best friend. However, at the town graveyard, Huck and Tom witness a murder, carried out by local vagabond Injun Joe. They vow never to tell a soul about what they have seen and so begins their journey into adulthood as Tom wrestles with his own morality, guilt and anxiety.             A ‘coming of age’ tale, it is through Tom’s adventures and relationships with others that he becomes more responsible and more aware of his own inner conflict. Through the central characters of Tom and Huck, Twain satirises the moral rigidity of society and adult hypocrisy, whilst at the same time giving a nostalgic portrayal of a young boy’s journey into adulthood.",

As a patriotic epic imitating Homer, the Aeneid also set out to provide Rome with a literature equal to that of Greece. It tells of Aeneas, survivor of the sack of Troy, and of his seven-year journey: to Carthage, where he falls tragically in love with Queen Dido; then to the underworld,; and finally to Italy, where he founds Rome. It is a story of defeat and exile, of love and war, hailed by Tennyson as 'the stateliest measure ever moulded by the lips of man'.  Translated with an Introduction by DAVID WEST",

        "summary": "The Affair by Lee ChildMarch 1997. A woman has her throat cut behind a bar in Carter Crossing, Mississippi. Just down the road is a big army base. Is the murderer a local guy - or is he a soldier? Jack Reacher, still a major in the military police, is sent in undercover. The county sheriff is a former U.S. Marine - and a stunningly beautiful woman. Her investigation is going nowhere. Is the Pentagon stonewalling her? Or doesn't she really want to find the killer? The adrenaline-pumping, high-voltage action in \"The Affair\" is set just six months before the opening of \"Killing Floor\", and it marks a turning point in Reacher's career. If he does what the army wants, will he be able to live with himself? And if he doesn't, will the army be able to live with him? And is this his last case in uniform?",

        "summary": "The Affair of the Poisons by Anne SomersetThe 'Affair of the Poisons' was a scandal at which 'all France trembled' and which 'horrified the whole of Europe' as it implicated a number of prominent persons at the court of King Louis XIV in the late 17th century. Parisian society was seized by a fad for spiritualist seances, fortune- telling, and the use of love potions. The most celebrated case was that of La Voisin, a midwife and fortune-teller whose real name was Catherine Deshayes Monvoisin and whose clientele included the Marquise de Montespan, Olympe Mancini and Marshal Luxembourg. No formal charges were made, and there is no evidence that they were seriously implicated, yet a permanent stain was left on their names. La Voisin was burned as a poisoner and a sorceress in 1680. A special court was instituted to judge cases of poisoning and witchcraft, and the poison epidemic came to an end in France.This bizarre witchhunt, which embroiled the gilded denizens of Versailles with the most sordid dregs of Paris society, remains both a fascinating enigma and an utterly compelling story.",

        "summary": "Afghanistan by Martin EwansA fascinating chronicle of a nation's turbulent history.  Reaching back to earliest times, Martin Ewans examines the historical evolution of one of today's most dangerous breeding grounds of global terrorism. After a succession of early dynasties and the emergence of an Afghan empire during the eighteenth century, the nineteenth and early twentieth century saw a fierce power struggle between Russia and Britain for supremacy in Afghanistan that was ended by the nation's proclamation of independence in 1919. A communist coup in the late 1970s overthrew the established regime and led to the invasion of Soviet troops in 1979. Roughly a decade later, the Soviet Union withdrew, condemning Afghanistan to a civil war that tore apart the nation's last remnants of religious, ethnic, and political unity. It was into this climate that the Taliban was born. Today, war-torn and economically destitute, Afghanistan faces unique challenges as it looks toward an uncertain future. Martin Ewans carefully weighs the lessons of history to provide a frank look at Afghanistan's prospects and the international resonances of the nation's immense task of total political and economic reconstruction.",

As the ivory trade continued there are now only five countries with sizeable elephant populations, where a few hundred years ago there were forty-six - before the European hunters arrived.

        "summary": "African-American Art by Sharon F PattonAfrican-American art has made an increasingly vital contribution to the art of the United States from the time of its origins in early-eighteenth-century slave communities. Folk and decorative arts such as ceramics, furniture, and quilts are discussed alongside fine art -- sculpture, painting, and photography -- produced by African Americans, both enslaved and free, throughout the nineteenth century. Twentieth-century developments are given full coverage, particularly the New Negro Movement of the 1920s, the Era of Civil Rights and Black Nationalism through the 1960s and 1970s, and the emergence of new black artists and theorists in the 1980s and 1990s.   New evidence has provided an exciting myriad of perspectives about African-American art, confirming that it represents the culture and society from which it emerges. Professor Patton explores significant issues such as the relationship of art and politics, the influence of galleries and museums, the growth of black universities, critical theory, the impact of artists' collectives, and the assortment of art practices since the 1960s. African-American Art shows that in its cultural diversity and synthesis of cultures it mirrors those in American society as a whole.   `African-American Art should be read by teachers, students, and writers, and on the shelves of every library. Professor Patton begins this impressive book with the slave ships that brought Africans to this country and gives evidence of the fine metalworking, carving, carpentry, basketry, weaving, and clay building skills passed from Africa through the works of valued but nameless slave-artisans. She tells how we learned accidentally about a few named artists like the slave, Scipio Moorhead, who in 1773 engraved the only surviving image of poet, Phyllis Wheatley. She describes the portraitists, furniture makers and highly skilled artisans. Sharon Patton follows a path leading from great African formal styles, which, mixed with the powerful expressive force of struggle and opposition, led to distinctive new ideasfrom the quilts of Harriet Powers in the late 1800s to the paintings of Jean Michel Basquiat in the 1980s. She helps the reader to think and search for the evidence of the art-making skills that not only survived the Middle Passage, but the many erasings of the auction block and racism's lack, little and denial. In a fine survey of contemporary African-American art and ideas complete with words from the artists themselvesPatton takes us first through its foundations and the through the movements, people and ideas that surrounded and generated this art. An art historian, curator, and scholar, Patton has produced a volume which, like no other, can be used both as an unusual reference book and a good read on an important part of American art. The illustrations are a special treat.'  Emma Amos, Artist Professor of Art, Rutgers University   `For a long period of time there has been an acknowledged need for a comprehensive text that integrates the full range of African American artistry, the building crafts, slave craftsmanship, the decorative and the fine arts tradition into one scholarly document. Professor Patton has brought those elements of history into her text that are often omitted in the available texts on the subject of African-American art and much of what she has written is primary information not previously recorded outside the context of social history.   The cultural context in which Professor Patton has written accounts of the artistry of African-American artists and craftsmen from the period of American slavery to the present is illuminating, analytically sound, and well documented. She has brought to the attention of the reader a number of topics such as 'Art Institutions and the Artist's Groups' that have not been thoroughly discussed in previous texts on the subject. A subject such as 'The Plantation House', the place where many decorative arts originated in the slave society is a welcomed addition to Professor Patton's historical overview.'  David Driskell, Artist Distinguished University Professor of Art, University of Maryland   `Sharon Patton has written a much needed text which surveys the broad scope of the history of African-American art from slavery to the present. She has followed a different tack, tracing art themes and their development throughout the history, rather than the influences of specific artists or periods. Thus, she shows how ideas such as crafts, formal painting and sculpture, or architecture, co-existed with equal importance to the culture from the times of the Colonies. In so doing, she breaks down the barrier between folk and formal art, and articulates an interrelationship of both concepts to African-American people and their culture. Her book expands the framework for the visual arts in the United States in the last two centuries.'  Professor Keith Morrison, Dean, College of Creative Arts, San Francisco State University",

        "summary": "African Dream by Che GuevaraThe complete text of the campaign diaries kept by Guevara in the Congo in 1965-1966. In January 1965 Ernesto Guevara, one of the heroes of the Cuban Revolutionary War and a minister in Fidel Castro's government, vanished. His sudden disappearance was a subject for conjecture all over the world. He eventually surfaced in the heart of Africa where, with 100 Cuban guerilla fighters to assist him, he put into action his theories of how to help the oppressed peoples of Africa throw off the yoke of colonial imperialism. His first task was to help the young Laurent Kabila in his struggle against the dictator Mobutu, who had seized power in the newly independent Congo following the assassination of Patrice Lumumba. The diaries that Guevara kept during his months in Africa record a political, strategic and ideological failure: the first steps, in fact, in the catastrophic, if heroic, adventure that ultimately led to Guevara's death in the jungles of Bolivia and to the creation of one of the most romantic and potent legends of our time.",

Bridget O'Connor was one of the great short story writers of her generation. She had a voice that was viscerally funny and an eye for both the glaring reality and the absurdity of the everyday.  In After A Dance, we meet a selection of O'Connor's most memorable characters often living on the margin of their own lives: from the anonymous thief set on an unusual prize to the hungover best man clinging to what he's lost, to the unrepentant gold-digger who always comes out on top. From unravelling narcissists to melancholy romantics all human life is here - at its best and at its delightful worst.",

She is an expert geographer of the landscape of American public culture (The New York Times Book Review).Here, Didion covers ground from Washington to Los Angeles, from a TV producer's gargantuan manor to the racial battlefields of New York's criminal courts.At each stop she uncovers the mythic narratives that elude other observers: Didion tells us about the fantasies the media construct around crime victims and presidential candidates; she gives us new interpretations of the stories of Nancy Reagan and Patty Hearst; she charts America's rollercoaster ride through evanescent booms and hard times that won't go away.A bracing amalgam of skepticism and sympathy,After Henryis further proof of Joan Didion's infallible radar for the true spirit of our age.",

        "summary": "After Progress by Anthony O'hearAs we stand on the brink of the third millennium, a large part of the human race may feel justified in a certain complacency. We are very much in thrall to the idea that history is moving forward in a desirable - or progressive - direction. In much of the world - and certainly in its most prosperous parts - we are all basically liberal, fundamentally pacific and reasonably affluent. Anthony O'Hear argues in this text that we need to temper our optimism and self-assurance, that progress is not inevitable in any field. His theme centres around the loss which is inextricably linked with progress, especially the sort of progress made in the West over the last few centuries. Could it be that the type of material and political advancements on which we pride ourselves is directly responsible for our spiritual and aesthetic decline? O'Hear believes that our era is one of technological progress and of individual rights and needs, and that our institutions and economies are largely geared to promoting the two. This text examines the implications of this state of affairs: that for most of us there is nothing worth striving for beyond individual happiness; and that there is little in our common culture to sustain ideas of excellence in serious pursuits. It addresses the question of real happiness and satisfaction and probes the dimensions that cannot be accounted for in scientific terms: love and beauty, the sense of moral obligation and reason itself.",

An enigmatic encounter in Copenhagen takes an IT consultant down a rabbit hole of speculation that proves more seductive than sex. The collapse of a love triangle in London leads to a dangerous, hypnotic addiction. In the Nevada desert, a grieving man tries to merge with an unearthly machine.  After the Sun opens portals to our newest realities, haunting the margins of a globalised world that's both saturated with yearning and brutally transactional. Infused with an irrepressible urgency, Eika's fiction seems to have conjured these far-flung characters and their encounters in a single breath. Juxtaposing startling beauty with grotesquery, balancing the hyperrealistic with the fantastical, he has invented new modes of storytelling for an era when the old ones no longer suffice.",

She knew he could be cruel, but when a bombshell revelation is dropped about the origins of their relationship-and Hardin's mysterious past-Tessa is beside herself.

Sharrow was once the leader of a personality-attuned combat team in one of the sporadic little commercial wars in the civilisation based around the planet Golter. Now she is hunted by the Huhsz, a religious cult which believes that she is the last obstacle before the faith's apotheosis, and her only hope of escape is to find the last of the apocalyptically powerful Lazy Guns before the Huhsz find her.  Her journey through the exotic Golterian system is a destructive and savage odyssey into her past, and that of her family and of the system itself.  Praise for Iain M.

        "summary": "Against Expression by Craig DworkinIn much the same way that photography forced painting to move in new directions, the advent of the World Wide Web, with its proliferation of easily transferable and manipulated text, forces us to think about writing, creativity, and the materiality of language in new ways. In Against Expression, editors Craig Dworkin and Kenneth Goldsmith present the most innovative works responding to the challenges posed by these developments.  Charles Bernstein has described conceptual poetry as \"poetry pregnant with thought.\" Against Expression, the premier anthology of conceptual writing, presents work that is by turns thoughtful, funny, provocative, and disturbing. Dworkin and Goldsmith, two of the leading spokespersons and practitioners of conceptual writing, chart the trajectory of the conceptual aesthetic from early precursors including Samuel Beckett and Marcel Duchamp to the most prominent of today’s writers. Nearly all of the major avant-garde groups of the past century are represented here, including Dada, OuLiPo, L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E, and Flarf to name just a few, but all the writers are united in their imaginative appropriation of found and generated texts and their exploration of nonexpressive language. Against Expression is a timely collection and an invaluable resource for readers and writers alike.",

        "summary": "Against the Grade by Bob Swallow'This book is not just an invaluable piece of social history and railway folklore, it is a treasure trove of tales and a joy to read'. The Settle to Carlisle line has become famous far beyond the realms of railway enthusiasts for many reasons. An improbable main line climbing through spectacular mountain scenery, it has long been legendary as a magnificent setting for steam locomotives working against the grade. What has until now received less emphasis are the true tales of men - and women - who have metaphorically worked against the grade to keep the line running in conditions often challenging in the extreme. Mike Harding says it all in his foreword to this long-awaited book: \"It is the human stories that have always set the Settle-Carlisle apart from other lesser lines, and those you will find here in plenty; true gems told simply by men and women who have worked on the line or lived alongside it. This book is not just an invaluable piece of social history and railway folklore, it is a treasure trove of tales and a joy to read\".Here is brought to life the drama of keeping the tracks clear of snow in past winters that make the recent conditions of 2010/11 seem comparatively easy. Here too is the saga of the railway family who lived at Blea Moor, a location so remote that the only way a daughter could leave for her wedding was in the grimy cab of a steam locomotive! There are many similar tales all firmly set on one of the great railway wonders of the world. Hitherto unpublished photographs and cartoon-style line drawings complete this compelling book.",

        "summary": "Agatha Christie: The Finished Portrait by Andrew NormanIn Agatha Christie: The Finished Portrait, Dr Andrew Norman delves deep into the crime writer’s past to discover the desperate insecurity that sparked her disappearance in 1926. Agatha Christie suffered from recurrent nightmares where she was petrified that one or other of her family would be replaced by a terrifying figure called the ‘Gunman’ and lost to her forever. She was reminded of this figure both when her father died, and when her husband Archie demanded a divorce. This event precipitated such a crisis in Agatha’s mind that she became temporarily unhinged. She lost her memory and assumed a new identity: that of her husband’s mistress. Only now, thirty years after Agatha’s death, is it possible to explain fully, in the light of scientific knowledge, her behaviour during her troubled disappearance, when she lived incognito in a Harrogate hotel.  One of Agatha’s novels, Unfinished Portrait, which is largely autobiographical, gives a unique insight into how the heroine, Celia (who is really Agatha in disguise), may have managed finally to rid herself of the Gunman and go on to lead a happier and more fulfilled life. By deciphering clues from this and her other works, Agatha Christie: The Finished Portrait sheds light on what is perhaps the greatest mystery of all to be associated with Agatha Christie, namely that of the person herself.",

        "summary": "Agatha Raisin and the Busy Body by Mc BeatonAgatha Raisin has never been one for enforced holiday cheer, but her friendly little village of Carsely has always prided itself on its traditional Christmas festivities. But this year the bells will not be ringing out Silent Night as Mr John Sunday, an officer with the Cotswold Health and Safety Board, has chosen Christmas as the time to crack down what he sees as gross misconduct by every man, woman, and child in the vicinity. The village shop is told it can no longer have wooden shelves which have been there since the time of Queen Victoria 'in case someone is inflicted with a splinter'. The village school is ordered to leave lights on at night 'to prevent unauthorized intruders from tripping in the dark'. And children are warned to not play with 'counterfeit banknotes' after passing around toy money in the playground. But finally Mr Sunday goes too far when he rules that there cannot be a Christmas tree atop the church tower this year. Soon after the decree and just before Christmas, Agatha is sipping a cup of tea and trying to stay awake as minute by minute of the Carsely Ladies Society meeting at the vicarage drones on when a sudden scream wakes her from her stupor. The ladies rush out of the building and into the garden to find Sunday lying face down in the petunias, very much dead. Agatha is instantly on the case, but with so many people having threatened the life of the victim, it's almost impossible to know where to start.

Lord Bellington, Carsely's biggest landholder,  has enraged locals by saying he is going to sell off their allotments to  make way for a new housing development.  So when he turns up dead,  poisoned by antifreeze, nobody mourns his passing.  On another  fine summer's day Agatha visits Carsley's allotments where everything  looks peaceful and perfect: people of all ages digging in the soil and  working hard to grow their own fruit and veg.  Agatha feels almost  tempted to take on a strip herself . . . but common sense soon prevails.   She doesn't really like getting her hands dirty.  She is  introduced to three oldtimers who have just taken over a new strip;  Harry Perry, Bunty Daventry and Josephine Merriweather are lamenting the  neglected condition of the patch.  But as Harry starts to shovel  through the weeds and grass his spade comes across something hard so he  bends down and tries to move the object.  And then he starts to yell . .  .   The body is that of Peta Currie, a newcomer to the village -  but who would want to murder her?  Blonde and beautiful she's every  local male's favourite.  And then Lord Bellingham's son engages Agatha  to do some digging of her own and very soon Agatha is thrown into a  world of petty feuds, jealousies and disputes over land.

        "summary": "Agatha Raisin: There Goes The Bride by Mc BeatonAgatha's former husband James is engaged to be married to a beautiful, young woman and Agatha has been kindly invited to the wedding. To take her mind off this, Agatha decides she has fallen for Sylvan, a Frenchman she met at James' engagement party. To distract her still further she decides upon a holiday and flies to Istanbul, where unfortunately she bumps into James and his fiancée not once but twice - convincing him she is stalking them.  So when the bride is murdered on her wedding day, naturally Agatha is Suspect Number One - but then matters are turned on their head when the dead bride's mother engages Agatha to take on the case of her murdered daughter! And very soon Agatha's own life is in danger while she tries to solve the mystery of the corpse bride while fighting off (halfheartedly) the advances of a very attractive and determined Frenchman!   Praise for the Agatha Raisin series:  'M. C. Beaton's imperfect heroine is an absolute gem.'   Publishers Weekly  'The detective novels of M. C. Beaton, a master of outrageous black comedy, have reached cult status.'   The Times  'Agatha Raisin is sharp, witty, hugely intelligent, unfailingly entertaining, delightfully intolerant and oh so magnificently non PC. M C Beaton has created a new national treasure... the stories zing along and are irresistible, unputdownable, a joy. If you buy one book a year, let it be this. Agatha Raisin is The Strongest Link.'

        "summary": "Ageing Rewired by Lynne DorlingLynne Dorling, MCIPD and positive psychology coach, has spent the last couple of years researching the topic of ‘positive ageing’. In Ageing Rewired, she shares findings from her own research, coaching case studies and highlights from selected secondary research on this topic. The demographic age shift has been well documented and for the first time ever in the UK, there are more people aged 60 and over than there are aged 19 and below. Whilst this obviously has huge implications for society, health systems and government, Lynne tackles the issue from an individual perspective encouraging people to take a more proactive approach to their own ageing process. Much of the existing advice for approaching later life focuses on the physical elements of ageing. Ageing Rewired tackles this subject from an emotional and psychological angle. There is some compelling evidence for the advantages of taking control of our own mind set to optimise our later years.        Lynne has identified 8 positive character traits which ‘super agers’ have in common and draws on her 20 years of coaching experience to illustrate these. The good news is that all of these traits can be developed. The book defines each characteristic, explains why it’s important and offers tips and techniques for enhancement. She challenges some of the negative stereotypes and assumptions around ageing, show casing real life pioneers who live and breathe the qualities we can all influence if we choose to do so. Lynne also sets the tone and engages the reader by sharing her own personal experiences of ageing.",

Research (examined and cited in detail within this book) shows that iterative methods reduce the risk of failure, compared to traditional models of development. This book is an efficient introduction for both managers and practitioners that need a distilled and carefully organized learning aid for the hands-on practices from planning to requirements to testing and the values that define these methods. The author also provides evidence of the value of switching to agile and iterative methods. By studying this book, the reader will learn to apply the key ideas in agile and iterative development, the details and comparison of four influential iterative methods (Scrum, Extreme Programming, Evo, and the Unified Process), answers to frequently asked questions, and important related management skills. The book's goal is quality information that can be quickly understood and applied.",

        "summary": "Agincourt by Juliet BarkerAgincourt took place on 25 October 1415 and was a turning-point not only in the Hundred Years War between England and France but also in the history of weaponry.  Azincourt (as it is now) is in the Pas-de-Calais, and the French were famously defeated by an army led by Henry V.   Henry V's stunning victory revived England's military prestige and greatly strengthened his territorial claims in France.  The exhausted English army of about 9,000 men was engaged by 20,000 Frenchmen, but the limited space of battle favoured the more compact English forces.  The undisciplined charges of the French combined with the exceptional skill of the English archers contributed to a pivotal moment in European warfare.  Not more than 1,600 English soldiers died; the French probably lost more than 6,000 men.  Juliet Barker's shimmeringly brilliant narrative commemorates and analyses a canonical battle in British history.",

On 25th October 1415, on a French hillside near the village of Agincourt, four men sheltered from the rain and prepared for battle. All four were English  knights, ancestors of Sir Ranulph Fiennes, and part of the army of England's King Henry V. Across the valley, four sons of the French arm of the Fiennes family were confident that the Dauphin's army would win the day...   Ranulph Fiennes explains how his own ancestors were key players through the centuries of turbulent Anglo-French history  that led up to  Agincourt, and he uses his experience as expedition leader and soldier to give us a fresh perspective on one of the bloodiest periods of medieval history.   With fascinating detail on the battle plans, weaponry and human drama of Agincourt, this is a gripping evocation of a historical event integral to English identity.",

        "summary": "Agogo Bells to Xylophone by Maggie CottonAgogo bells to Xylophone is just what it says – a friendly guide to all those instruments which clog up the music cupboard and don't come with an instruction manual. Maggie Cotton's clever descriptions and Alison Dexter's clear illustrations unlock the magic of these often misunderstood music makers.             The book is a treasury of simple but effective techniques for getting the best from classroom instruments – from holding claves correctly so that the sound carries, to the party trick of the tambourine thumb trill. And there are sections on care and safety, restoring damaged instruments, and advice on instruments for children with special needs.             An invaluable handbook for every school – now with a fresh new cover.",

        "summary": "Aid State by Jake JohnstonHaiti’s state is near-collapse: armed groups have overrun the country, many government officials have fled after the 2021 assassination of President Moise, refugees desperately set out on boats to reach the US and Latin America, and the economy reels from the after-effects of disasters, both man-made and natural, that destroyed much of Haiti’s infrastructure. How did a nation founded on liberation - a people that successfully revolted against their colonisers and enslavers - come to such a precipice?  In Aid State, Jake Johnston, researcher and writer at the Center for Economic and Policy Research, reveals how US and European capitalist goals re-enslaved Haiti under the guise of helping it. To the global West, Haiti has always been a place where labor is cheap, politicians are compliant, and profits are to be made. Over the course of nearly 100 years, the US has sought to control Haiti with occupying police, military, and euphemistically-called peacekeeping forces, as well as hand-picked leaders meant to quell uprisings and protect corporate interests. Earthquakes and hurricanes only further hurt a state already decimated by the aid industrial complex.  Based on years of on-the-ground reporting in Haiti and interviews with politicians in the US and Haiti, UN officials, and Haitians who struggle for their lives, homes, and families, Aid State is a conscience-searing book of witness.",

ROWAN WILLIAMS, FORMER ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY  'A MUST READ.' MIQDAAD VERSI, MUSLIM COUNCIL OF BRITAIN  'A COMPELLING AND COMPASSIONATE SURVEY OF BRITISH ISLAM.’ THE GUARDIAN  'A TIMELY BOOK.' BARONESS WARSI  'HUGELY IMPORTANT.' PETER OBORNE  'HEARTENING.' DAVID ANDERSON QC  In this groundbreaking book, James Fergusson travels the length of Britain to explore our often misunderstood Muslim communities, and to experience life on both sides of our increasingly segregated society.  The face of Britain is changing. The Muslim population has more than doubled over the last twenty years, and is projected to do so again over the next twenty. A societal shift of this size and speed has inevitably brought growing pains, with the impact on our communities becoming ever more profound – as well as painful, because in the eyes of many, Islam has a problem: the extremist views of a tiny minority, which, when translated into action, can result in catastrophic violence.   The danger of this extremist threat - or our response to it - is that we are collectively starting to lose faith in the cultural diversity that has glued our nation together for so long. Our tolerance of others, so often celebrated as a ‘fundamental British value,’ is at risk.  In this groundbreaking book, James Fergusson travels the length of Britain to evaluate the impact these seismic shifts have had on our communities. With the rise of nationalist movements, growing racial tensions and an increasingly out of touch political elite, what does it mean to be a Muslim in Britain? What is life like on both sides of this growing religious divide? And what can we do to heal the fractures appearing in our national fabric?  Al-Britannia, My Country is a timely and urgent account of life in Britain today, a call to action filled with real-life experience, hard truths and important suggestions for our future.",

Diarising his ramble in the form of a 'journey journal', Alan details the people and places he encounters, ruminates on matters large and small and, on a final leg fraught with danger, becomes - not a man (because he was one to start off with) - but a better, more inspiring example of a man.   This deeply personal book is divided into chapters and has a colour photograph on the front cover. It is deeply personal. Through witty vignettes, heavy essays and nod-inducing pieces of wisdom, Alan shines a light on the nooks of the nation and the crannies of himself, making this a biography that biographs the biographer while also biographing bits of Britain.",

Alan Turing was the extraordinary Cambridge mathematician who masterminded the cracking of the German Enigma ciphers and transformed the Second World War. But his vision went far beyond this crucial achievement. Before the war he had formulated the concept of the universal machine, and in 1945 he turned this into the first design for a digital computer.  Turing's far-sighted plans for the digital era forged ahead into a vision for Artificial Intelligence. However, in 1952 his homosexuality rendered him a criminal and he was subjected to humiliating treatment. In 1954, aged 41, Alan Turing committed suicide and one of Britain's greatest scientific minds was lost.",

For anyone who has taken the time to see my stand-up performances or watched my chat show, 'Chattyman', knows that my body has hardly been kind to me - in fact there've been times when we've actually stopped talking to each other. Balding, myopic, often flaky with psoriasis, back fat that hangs suspended like a cape, a voice that could strip varnish, an increasingly dodgy hip and even dodgier teeth. Why would you draw attention to it? you must ask. Couldn't you just call the book something else? Do you think the Great British Public is ready to pore over your body?   Well, as I turn forty and take stock of my showbiz life over the last ten years or so, I have learnt to embrace my flaws and face my shortcomings. In fact, strange as it might seem, the things I hate about myself have become my trademark and I am slowly, begrudgingly learning to, if not love them, to at least live with them. I am ready now to take a long hard look at myself and that's what Alanatomy is. It's the story of my rise to fame: the joys, the traumas, the parties, the disappointments. Hopefully you will find it witty, fun, heartwarming, but more importantly honest, and that it will keep you entertained every time you pick it up.   Alanatomy is the chance for you to get beneath my skin and see the real me because, and to continue the anatomical theme if I may, this showbiz existence can sometimes feel like an autopsy - picked at, probed and scrutinized with every inch of your body held up for analysis, but unlike an actual autopsy, you are very much alive.   So I give you Alanatomy: The Inside Story. I am laying myself out on the slab for your entertainment; naked, stripped bare. Grab your scalpel, peel back the skin and go deep, have a good old probe around at my life so far. Yes, you are going to find guts, a fair bit of cheek, maybe even a little bit of gristle, but hopefully, you'll find a whole lot of heart.",

Alex explains the surprising geometry of the 50p piece, and the strategy of how best to gamble it in a casino. He shines a light on the mathematical patterns in nature, and on the peculiar predictability of random behaviour. He eats a potato crisp whose revolutionary shape was unpalatable to the ancient Greeks, and he shows the deep connections between maths, religion and philosophy.  From the world's fastest mental calculators in Germany to numerologists in the US desert, from a startlingly numerate chimpanzee in Japan to venerable Hindu sages in India, these dispatches from 'Numberland' are an unlikely but exhilarating cocktail of history, reportage and mathematical proofs. The world of maths is a much friendlier and more colourful place than you might have imagined.  This anniversary edition is fully revised and updated.",

By directly engaging with the source of these attacks, Wilde's De Profundis upon which most previous biographies have been based, Caspar Wintermans is able to show that this was a work written in the depths of despair while Wilde was incarcerated, being passionate, cruel, and deeply untruthful. Wintermans proves that, far from being a rakish homme fatale, Alfred Douglas was in fact a supportive and kind lover who worshipped the playwright and whose life was destroyed by both those who loved and hated the ostentatiously homosexual Wilde. Accompanied by a long overdue annotated anthology of Douglas' poetry,Alfred Douglas: A Poet's Life and His Finest Workis a revealing and moving representation of a tragically misunderstood poet.",

Overshadowed for more than a century by his friends Monet, Renoir and Pissaro, he is at last receiving his deserved recognition. This biography of Sisley charts the development of his career from comfortable middle-class beginnings through the flowering of his artistic genius. Despite later poverty and continual critical neglect, the artist never wavered in his commitment to his paintings and his vision. He painted the world about him - churches, bridges, rivers, fields and trees in various moods and lights, and the changing sky which was his inspiration. His paintings, 60 of which are reproduced in this book, reflect the obsession with nature which was fundamental to the Impressionist movement. Vivienne Couldrey is a novelist and short-story writer, and the author of \"The Art of Louis Comfort Tiffany\".",

        "summary": "Alfred Wallis (St Ives Artists) by Matthew GaleOne of a series exploring the life and work of major artists associated with St Ives, this study of Alfred Wallis (1855-1942) sets out to revise previous accounts of his life in the light of new research. It also discusses the gradual development of his painting over 17 years of activity. Wallis spent most of his life in the Cornish ports of Newlyn, Penzance and St Ives, and went to sea as a young man. His main occupation was as a dealer in marine supplies, and it was only at the age of 70, and after the death of his wife, that he took up painting \"for company\". He sold his works for a few pence to anyone who wanted them, and died in the poorhouse near Penzance. He is now recognized as one of the most original British artists of the 20th century. After his encounter with Ben Nicholson and Christopher Wood in St Ives in 1928, his pictures of boats and harbours, produced on odd-shaped boards with the use of ordinary ship's paint, were an inspiration to artists seeking a new approach. The directness of his \"primitive\" vision and the object-like quality of his paintings were highly influential in the development of British Modernism. The book discusses the mythology that quickly grew up around Wallis's life, and at the sustained interest in an irascible eccentric whose work affected a whole generation of British artists.",

        "summary": "Alibaba by Duncan ClarkAn engrossing, insider's account of how a teacher built one of the world's most valuable companies-rivaling Walmart & Amazon-and forever reshaped the global economy.  In just a decade and half Jack Ma, a man from modest beginnings who started out as an English teacher, founded and built Alibaba into one of the world's largest companies, an e-commerce empire on which hundreds of millions of Chinese consumers depend. Alibaba's $25 billion IPO in 2014 was the largest global IPO ever. A Rockefeller of his age who is courted by CEOs and Presidents around the world, Jack is an icon for China's booming private sector and the gatekeeper to hundreds of millions of middle class consumers.  Duncan Clark first met Jack in 1999 in the small apartment where Jack founded Alibaba. Granted unprecedented access to a wealth of new material including exclusive interviews, Clark draws on his own experience as an early advisor to Alibaba and two decades in China chronicling the Internet's impact on the country to create an authoritative, compelling narrative account of Alibaba's rise.  How did Jack overcome his humble origins and early failures to achieve massive success with Alibaba? How did he outsmart rival entrepreneurs from China and Silicon Valley? Can Alibaba maintain its 80% market share? As it forges ahead into finance and entertainment, are there limits to Alibaba's ambitions?  How does the Chinese government view its rise?  Will Alibaba expand further overseas, including in the U.S.?  Clark tells Alibaba's tale in the context of China's momentous economic and social changes, illuminating an unlikely corporate titan as never before.",

        "summary": "alibaba by Liu Shiying\"Alibaba\" is about Alibaba.com and its founder Jack Ma, China's Bill Gates. Ma's story is remarkable: despite growing up in China during the Cultural Revolution, in a period of total state control of the economy, he developed keen entrepreneurial instincts that would eventually allow him to recognise the Internet's ability to transform the way business is done around the world. He realised that an 'ecosystem' had to be built on the Net in order to create a standard way for businesses to operate and then set about creating that ecosystem; with Alibaba.com, the world's biggest business-to-business Web site, you can buy and sell everything, from acrylic blankets to acoustic components, air beds to air-separators, abrasive tools to anchors - and that's just the first letter of the alphabet!Unlike Gates, Ma recognised the potential of the Internet early on, and at critical times made strategic decisions that allowed him to leverage his company to rapid growth. From an initial investment of $60,000 in 1999, Alibaba is now worth around approximately $26 billion and is one of the most acclaimed Internet companies out there. If Microsoft is successful in buying Yahoo (which owns 39 percent of Alibaba), the long-term visions of Bill Gates and Jack Ma may join forces - a scenario to watch.",

        "summary": "Alice by Hugo Vickers\"In 1953, at the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II, Princess Alice was dressed from head to foot in a long grey dress and a grey clock, and a nun's veil. Amidst all the jewels, and velvet and coronets, and the fine uniforms, she exuded an unworldly simplicity. As one who witnessed her process alone up the long aisle of the abbey put it, \"she looked as though she were walking into eternity\". Seated with the royal family, she was a part of them, yet somehow distanced from them. In as much as she is remembered at all today, it is as this shadowy figure in grey nun's clothes...\" Princess Alice, mother of Prince Philip, was something of a mystery figure even within her own family. She was born deaf, at Windsor Castle, in the presence of her great-grandmother, Queen Victoria, and brought up in England, Darmstadt and Malta. In 1903 she married Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark, and from then on her life was overshadowed by wars, revolutions and enforced periods of exile. By the time she was 35, virtually every point of stability was overthrown. Though the British royal family remained in the ascendant, her German family ceased to be ruling princes, her two aunts who had married Russian royalty came to savage ends, and soon afterwards Alice's own husband was nearly executed as a political scapegoat. The middle years of her life, which should have followed a conventional and fulfilling path, did the opposite. She suffered from a serious religious crisis and at the age of 45 was removed from her family and placed in a sanatorium in Switzerland, where she was pronounced a \"schizophrenic paranoid\". As her stay in the clinic became prolonged, there was a time when it seemed that she might never walk free again. How she achieved her recovery is just one of the remarkable aspects of her story.",
