    "price": "£25.00",
    "description": "Arrow VideoFrom Richard Linklater, the director of Slacker, Dazed & Confused and Before Sunrise, Boyhood is a ground-breaking cinematic achievement; a fictional drama made with the same group of actors over a 12-year period. At once epic and intimate, it is a one-of-a-kind trip through the exhilaration of childhood, the seismic shifts of modern family life, and the passage of time itself.Dreamy-eyed grade-schooler Mason (Ellar Coltrane) is facing upheaval: his struggling single mom Olivia (Patricia Arquette) has decided to move him and older sister Samantha (Lorelei Linklater) to Houston - just as their long-absent father Mason Sr. (Ethan Hawke) re-enters their world. Thus begins a decade of constantly unfolding heartbreak and wonder. Against the tide of family moves and controversies, faltering marriages and re-marriages, new schools, first loves, lost loves, good times and scary times that will shape him, Mason emerges to find his own road in life.A remarkable achievement that builds on Linklater's fascination with time, relationships and the ever-changing nature of our lives, Boyhood is a deeply moving experience that found praise from critics around the world and went on to win the award for Best Film at both the Golden Globes and British Academy Film Awards in 2015.Product Features4K ULTRA HD SPECIAL EDITION CONTENTS4K (2160p) UHD Blu-ray presentation in Dolby Vision (HDR10 compatible)Lossless DTS HD MA 5.1 audioOptional English subtitles for the deaf and hard of hearingWithout Ambition, One Starts Nothing, a featurette featuring American poet and critic Dan Chiasson in conversation with his son Louis Chiasson about their shared love and connection to the filmIn Search of Lost Time, a visual essay by critic and film-maker Scout TafoyaBefore and After Boyhood, an interview with Richard Linklater by film critic Rob Stone, author of Walk, Don't Run: The Cinema of Richard LinklaterRichard Linklater at the BFI, director Richard Linklater discusses Boyhood and his whole career in this on stage appearance at the British Film InstituteTheatrical trailerImage gallery",

    "description": "Arrow VideoWhen former child actor and Hollywood TV sidekick Bruce Lee returned to his native Hong Kong in 1971 to star in two films for fledgling company Golden Harvest, movie history was made thanks to one of the most iconic partnerships between star and studio that cinema has ever seen. In only a handful of films, Lee high-kicked his way into audiences’ imaginations forever, thanks to his blistering screen presence and his masterful ‘Jeet Kune Do’ fighting technique.The first two starring vehicles for Lee, The Big Boss and Fist of Fury (both directed by Lo Wei), smashed all box office records in Hong Kong and made him the most famous face on the continent. Lee asserted his artistic independence by directing, writing and starring in The Way of the Dragon, arguably his most thrilling and personal film. Tragically, on the cusp of achieving the international stardom he had long strived for, Bruce Lee died suddenly in 1973, aged only 32. Not to be outdone by the tidal wave of ‘Bruceploitation’ films that followed, Golden Harvest completed two posthumous films using unreleased footage, 1978’s Game of Death and its 1981 sequel, as well as two official documentaries, the first of which hit cinemas only three months after Lee’s death.

    "price": "£25.00",
    "description": "Arrow VideoDare you say his name five times? From the chilling imagination of horror master Clive Barker (Hellraiser, Nightbreed), comes Candyman - one of the greatest horror movies of the '90s, now restored on 4K UHD from Arrow Video.When grad student Helen Lyle (Virginia Madsen) begins working on a thesis about urban legends, she comes across the terrifying tale of the Candyman - a vengeful, hook-handed spirit who can be summoned by saying his name five times in the mirror. As her research leads her into the bowels of Chicago's deprived housing projects and deeper into the Candyman's world, Helen learns that some legends are best left well alone.Expertly directed by British filmmaker Bernard Rose (Paperhouse) and boasting an astounding score by composer Philip Glass, Candyman ingeniously reworks Clive Barker's original short story \"The Forbidden\" (originally published as part of his groundbreaking Books of Blood series) into a modern horror parable that remains as timely today as ever.Product Features4K restoration from the original negative, supervised and approved by writer-director Bernard Rose and director of photography Anthony B.

A seemingly dead woman awakes screaming in her coffin... And in the sleepy New England town of Dunwich, a girl vomits up her intestines and a local misfit has a drill bit ploughed into his cranium... These hallucinogenic, often grotesque visions punctuate a skeletal story telling of a reporter (Christopher George, The Exterminator, Pieces) and a psychic (Catriona MacColl, The House by the Cemetery, The Beyond) who must race against time to prevent hordes of rotting corpses spewing forth from the gates of hell...Stridently going beyond the classical stylings of his horror hit Zombie Flesh Eaters, City of the Living Dead sees Fulci eschew conventional narrative logic in favour of a delirious, oneiric mode of storytelling which stresses visuals, surrealism and atmosphere (as well as offering up bucket-loads of brains, blood and guts!). Presented here in a 4K restoration with a wealth of extras, Fulci's gore-drenched classic can now be devoured as never before!4K ULTRA HD BLU-RAY SPECIAL EDITION CONTENTSRestoration from a 4K scan of the original camera negative4K (2160p) UHD Blu-ray presentation in Dolby Vision (HDR10 compatible)Original uncompressed 1.0 mono, 2.0 stereo and optional 5.1 DTS-HD Master AudioOriginal English and Italian soundtracksOptional English subtitles for the deaf and hard of hearing for the English soundtrackOptional English subtitles for the Italian soundtrackAudio commentary with star Catriona MacColl and journalist Jay SlaterAudio commentary with star Giovanni Lombardo Radice and writer Calum WaddellWe Are the Apocalypse, interview with writer Dardano SacchettiThrough Your Eyes, interview with Catriona MacCollDust in the Wind, interview with cameraman Roberto Forges DavanzatiThe Art of Dreaming, interview with production designer Massimo Antonello GelengTales of Friendship, interview with cinematographer Sergio SalvatiI Walked with a Zombie, interview with actor Giovanni Lombardo RadiceThey Call Him \"Bombardone\", interview with special effects artist Gino De RossiThe Horror Family, interview with father and son actors Venantino and Luca VenantiniSongs from Beyond, interview with composer Fabio FrizziCarlo of the Living Dead, interview with actor Carlo De MejoBuilding Fulci's City, video appreciation by Stephen Thrower, author of the definitive tome, Beyond Terror: The Films of Lucio FulciReflections on Fulci, appraisal of Fulci's Gothic period by actor, writer and director Andy Nyman (Ghost Stories)The Dead Are Alive!, video essay by Kat Ellinger on Lucio Fulci and the Italian zombie cycleBehind the Fear, behind the scenes 8mm footage with Roberto Forges Davanzati audio commentaryThe Gates of Hell, alternative US theatrical release opening titlesOriginal trailers and radio spotsExtensive image gallery featuring over 150 stills, posters and other ephemera from the FAB Press and Mike Siegel archivesReversible sleeve featuring original and newly commissioned artwork by Colin Murdoch",

Edith falls in love with seductive stranger Thomas Sharpe (Tom Hiddleston, Avengers Assemble), who whisks her off to Allerdale Hall, his baronial, yet dilapidated English mansion built upon a mountain of blood-red clay. Here Edith meets Lucille (Jessica Chastain, Zero Dark Thirty), Thomas's sister who at times seems hostile and jealous. As Edith struggles to feel at home in the imposing residence, she gradually uncovers a horrendous family secret and encounters supernatural forces that will help her discover the terrible truth behind Crimson Peak.Boasting incredibly intricate and ornate production design and a rich visual style, del Toro's film is a grandiose, boldly baroque triumph of Gothic decadence, which expertly combines and contrasts the sublimely beautiful with the shockingly grotesque.

Taking a job as a casino croupier just to make ends meet, he finds himself seduced by the high stakes world of luck and chance.

When a shark escapes and attacks a pleasure boat, the company sponsoring the research threatens to pull its funding and sends corporate executive Russell Franklin (Samuel L. Jackson) to investigate. McAlester has just 48 hours to prove the value of her work, but her experiments have made the sharks smarter. No longer happy to be injected, prodded, and caged, they begin to turn the tables. As a freak storm causes chaos on the surface, making it impossible to leave, the facility is flooded and the scientists must fight to survive against the rising water and the hungry sharks that now swim freely through the corridors.Embracing action, horror and suspense with a knowing sense of humour and pushing them all as far as they can go, Deep Blue Sea is an adrenaline rush of pure entertainment presented in a brand new 4K restoration approved by director Renny Harlin.

    "description": "Arrow VideoFrom Lucio Fulci, the godfather of gore (City of the Living Dead, The House by the Cemetery), comes one of the most powerful and unsettling giallo thrillers ever produced: his 1972 masterpiece, Don't Torture a Duckling.When the sleepy rural village of Accendura is rocked by a series of murders of young boys, the superstitious locals are quick to apportion blame, with the suspects including the local \"witch\", Maciara (Florinda Bolkan, A Lizard in a Woman's Skin). With the bodies piling up and the community gripped by panic and a thirst for bloody vengeance, two outsiders - city journalist Andrea (Tomas Milian, The Four of the Apocalypse) and spoilt rich girl Patrizia (Barbara Bouchet, The Red Queen Kills Seven Times) - team up to crack the case. But before the mystery is solved, more blood will have been spilled, and not all of it belonging to innocents...Deemed shocking at the time for its brutal violence, depiction of the Catholic Church and themes of child murder and implied pedophilia, Don't Torture a Duckling is widely regarded today as Fulci's greatest film, rivalling the best of his close rival Dario Argento.

Smart and popular, Veronica (Winona Ryder, Stranger Things) is a reluctant member of the gang and disapproves of the other girls' cruel behaviour. When Veronica and her mysterious new boyfriend, JD (Christian Slater, True Romance), play a trick on the clique leader, Heather Chandler (Kim Walker), and accidentally poison her, they make it appear a suicide. But it soon becomes clear to Veronica that JD is a sociopath intent on vengefully killing the school's popular students. She races to stop him, clashing with the clique's new leader, Heather Duke (Shannen Doherty), and leading to an explosive final confrontation with her troubled former lover.Directed by Michael Lehmann, Heathers pushed the teen comedy into dark and nightmarish territory and is distinguished by the career defining central performances of its stars Winona Ryder and Christian Slater.

    "description": "EVIL HAS NEVER BEEN SO SEDUCTIVE.It is often said that films about the Devil are cursed with bad luck, but Leslie Stevens' Incubus might be the most cursed of them all. By the time it premiered in 1966, two of its stars had tragically taken their own lives; the eccentric director's insistence on filming in the obscure Esperanto language ensured it failed to receive any distribution; and it was nearly lost forever when the original elements were believed lost in a fire. Decades passed until it was finally saved and unveiled to the public in all its unholy glory!Wounded in battle, soldier Marc (William Shatner, just prior to being cast in Star Trek) ventures to the remote village of Nomen Tuum to find a well where the waters are said to be blessed with healing powers. Little does he suspect that the inhabitants of Nomen Tuum are demonic seductresses who entice interlopers and lead them to damnation, and one such succubus, Kia (Allyson Ames) has her sights on Marc. As an eclipse shrouds the sun and darkness falls over the village, Marc and Kia's relationship becomes more passionate... will his soul survive?Now restored in 4K from the last known surviving 35mm print, this eerie and unforgettable American folk horror from the creator of The Outer Limits survives to chill a new generation as never seen before. Stylishly filmed in Big Sur and other California locations by cinematographer (and future Academy Award winner) Conrad L.

    "title": "Love, Death & Apocalypse: Three Films by Álex de la Iglesia Limited Edition 4K UHD",
    "price": "£40.00",
    "description": "Arrow VideoOutrageous, absurdist, grotesque! Often hilarious, always stylish, and utterly unpredictable, the films of Spanish director Álex de la Iglesia are an exhilarating shock to the cinematic system.Produced by legendary provocateur Pedro Almodóvar, de la Iglesia's debut feature Acción Mutante is a violent sci-fi black comedy set in a post-apocalyptic world where attractive people hold all the power and a terrorist group, who see themselves as mutants, take arms to rid the world of their superficial oppressors. With his second feature, The Day of the Beast (El día de la bestia) de la Iglesia delivered one of the greatest horror comedies of all time as a Catholic priest joins forces with a heavy metal fan, and the host of a popular occult TV show to kill the Antichrist on Christmas Eve. A critical and commercial success around the world, The Day of the Beast paved the way for gonzo action-crime-horror Perdita Durango, (aka Dance with the Devil) a Spanish-US-Mexican co-production based on a novel by Barry Gifford (author of Wild at Heart). Starring Rosie Perez (Do the Right Thing), a then little known Javier Bardem (No Country for Old Men) and James Gandolfini (The Sopranos), Perdita Durango is a twisted tale of love, guns, drugs, voodoo ceremonies, and refrigerated foetuses...Making their UK debut on 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray with a wealth of new and archival extras, Arrow Video welcomes you to the delirious, diabolical and demented world of Álex de la Iglesia.

Burroughs’ controversial novel, Naked Lunch. Weaving together elements of Burroughs’ own remarkable biography with the content of the book, Cronenberg’s film steps inside the body and mind of an author to depict the dangerous act of imagination itself from the inside out.Former junkie William Lee (Peter Weller, RoboCop) makes ends meet as an exterminator. But when he and his wife Joan (Judy Davis, Barton Fink) discover the hallucinatory properties of the powder he uses to kill bugs, they become hooked, and their world is changed forever. Insects speak, typewriters mutate and talk, interdimensional beings reveal themselves, identities fracture and blur; nothing and no one is quite what it seems. When Bill, under the influence of drugs, or the bugs that have begun talking to him, shoots his wife, he flees to Interzone, at once a place and a state of mind, where things only get stranger.Winner of Best Picture, Best Direction, and Best Screenplay at the 1992 Genie Awards and winner of the National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Director, the film also features a superb supporting cast including Roy Scheider (Jaws) and an astonishing score by Howard Shore (The Fly), featuring Ornette Coleman.

    "description": "The mid-nineties were a fertile period for the vampire movie. Big-name stars such as Tom Cruise and Eddie Murphy flocked to genre, as did high-caliber filmmakers like Francis Ford Coppola, veterans Wes Craven and John Landis, independents Michael Almereyda and Jeffrey Arsenault, and up-and-comers Quentin Tarantino and Guillermo del Toro. Amid the fangs and crucifixes, Abel Ferrara reunited with his King of New York star Christopher Walken for The Addiction, a distinctly personal take on creatures of the night.Philosophy student Kathleen (Lili Taylor, The Conjuring) is dragged into an alleyway on her way home from class by Casanova (Annabella Sciorra, The Hand That Rocks the Cradle) and bitten on the neck. She quickly falls ill but realizes this isn't any ordinary disease when she develops an aversion to daylight and a thirst for human blood...Having made a big-budget foray into science fiction two years earlier with Body Snatchers, Ferrara's approach to the vampire movie is in a lower key. Shot on the streets of New York, like so many of his major works - including The Driller Killer, Ms. 45 and Bad Lieutenant - and beautifully filmed in black and white, The Addiction sees the filmmaker on his own terms and at his very best: raw, shocking, intense, intelligent, masterful.LIMITED EDITION CONTENTSBrand new 4K restoration from the original camera negative by Arrow Films4K (2160p) UHD Blu-ray™ presentation in Dolby Vision (HDR10/compatible)Optional lossless 5.1 and 2.0 soundtracksOptional English subtitles for the deaf and hard of hearingAudio commentary by director Abel Ferrara, moderated by critic and biographer Brad StevensTalking with the Vampires, a 2018 documentary about the film, featuring actors Christopher Walken and Lili Taylor, composer Joe Delia, cinematographer Ken Kelsch, and Ferrara himself2018 interview with Abel Ferrara2018 interview with Brad StevensAbel Ferrara Edits The Addiction, an archival piece from the time of productionOriginal trailerImage galleryReversible sleeve featuring original and newly commissioned artwork by Peter StrainIllustrated collector's booklet featuring writing on the film by critic Michael Ewins and an archival interview with Ferrara by Paul Duane",

    "description": "Arrow VideoBefore he created Westworld and Jurassic Park, Michael Crichton first blurred the line between science fiction and science fact with his breakout success The Andromeda Strain. Two years after the novel's publication, Robert Wise (The Haunting) directed the film adaptation, a nail-biting blend of clinically-realised docudrama and astonishing sci-fi visuals that ushered in a new subgenre: the \"killer virus\" biological thriller.A government satellite crashes outside a small town in New Mexico - and within minutes, every inhabitant of the town is dead, except for a crying baby and an elderly derelict. The satellite and the two survivors are sent to Wildfire, a top-secret underground laboratory equipped with a nuclear self-destruct mechanism to prevent the spread of infection in case of an outbreak. Realising that the satellite brought back a lethal organism from another world, a team of government scientists race against the clock to understand the extraterrestrial virus - codenamed \"Andromeda\" - before it can wipe out all life on the planet.Aided by innovative visual effects by Douglas Trumbull (2001: A Space Odyssey; Silent Running) and an unforgettable avant-garde electronic music score by Gil Mellé (The Sentinel), Wise's suspense classic still haunts to this day, and is presented here in a stunning 4K restoration from the original negative.Product Features4K ULTRA HD LIMITED EDITION CONTENTS4K restoration from the original camera negative by Arrow Films4K (2160p) Ultra HD Blu-ray presentation in Dolby Vision (HDR10 compatible)Original lossless mono audioOptional English subtitles for the deaf and hard of hearingAudio commentary by critic Bryan ReesmanA New Strain of Science Fiction, an appreciation by critic Kim NewmanThe Andromeda Strain: Making the Film, an archive featurette from 2001 directed by Laurent Bouzereau and featuring interviews with director Robert Wise and screenwriter Nelson GiddingA Portrait of Michael Crichton, an archival featurette from 2001 directed by Laurent Bouzereau and featuring an interview with author Michael CrichtonCinescript Gallery, highlights from the annotated and illustrated shooting script by Nelson GiddingTheatrical trailer, TV spots and radio spotsImage galleryIllustrated collector's booklet featuring writing by Peter Tonguette and select archive materialReversible sleeve featuring original and newly commissioned artwork by Corey Brickley",

    "description": "THE ONLY WITNESS TO THE CRIME WAS NOT EVEN THEREDirector Sam Raimi combined the spooky underpinnings of his early work with his newly proven talent for handling powerful drama in the supernatural thriller The Gift, coaxing nuanced performances from a star-studded cast to bring a gripping script by Billy Bob Thornton & Tom Epperson (One False Move) to life.In rural Georgia, recently widowed psychic Annie Wilson (Cate Blanchett) works as a tarot reader to support her young family. When she is introduced to her son’s affable school principal (Greg Kinnear) and his socialite fiancée (Katie Holmes), Annie has a grisly premonition of things yet to come. After her violent vision comes true, all eyes turn to Annie, leaving her with no choice but to use her clairvoyant abilities to find the culprit herself. Could it be the abusive husband (Keanu Reeves) of one of Annie’s regular clients (Hilary Swank)? Or the nervy mechanic (Giovanni Ribisi) whose yearning for friendship masks an uncontrollable rage? Or is another terrible secret hiding in plain sight?Made right before a certain web-slinger finally catapulted Raimi from the cult fringes onto Hollywood’s A-list, The Gift is an underappreciated but vital entry in his filmography that is ripe for reappraisal with this brand new 4K remaster.4K ULTRA HD LIMITED EDITION CONTENTSNew 4K remaster from the 35mm interpositive by Arrow Films and Shout!

    "description": "Arrow VideoWith the two preceding films in his \"Dollars\" trilogy having unleashed a boom in Euro Western productions, Sergio Leone knew that his concluding chapter would have to top them all. Armed with his largest budget yet, Leone created what is, for many, the final word on the subject - a violent, picaresque epic presented with operatic scope and intensity, with Clint Eastwood donning the iconic hat and poncho one last time.A partnership between two scoundrels, Blondie (Eastwood) and Tuco (Eli Wallach) goes awry, only for fate to intervene in the form of information about a cache of stolen Confederate gold buried in a graveyard. Each possessing a different clue to its location, the pair are forced into a distrustful partnership. However, the gold is also sought by Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef), a ruthless mercenary with his own twisted code of honour. Thus begins a desperate pursuit amidst the mass destruction and absurdity of the American Civil War, culminating in an iconic three-way standoff inside the graveyard.Mythic, cynical and endlessly entertaining, The Good, The Bad and The Ugly brings Leone's grand sense of dramatic scale to its apotheosis. Arrow Films is proud to present this landmark Western in the most comprehensive edition ever assembled, featuring multiple cuts of the film, all meticulously restored in glorious 4K, and a wealth of new and archival bonus materials.Product FeaturesFULL SPECS ANNOUNCED IN MARCH!",

    "description": "Arrow VideoDO NOT TRUST ANYONE.Since its first publication in 1955, Jack Finney's classic sci-fi/horror novel The Body Snatchers has inspired numerous adaptations and created a whole subgenre of era-defining alien doppelgangers in books, film, and TV. 2007's The Invasion was ahead of the curve, its eerily predictive shift toward a virus-like contagion more frighteningly resonant in a post-pandemic world.A space shuttle crashes to Earth carrying an alien organism. Soon people are changing, becoming detached and emotionless. People like CDC director Tucker Kaufman (Jeremy Northam) who is investigating the crash. Meanwhile his ex-wife, psychiatrist Carol Bennell (Nicole Kidman), sees the same behaviour in a friend of their son, and a patient claims that her husband is no longer her husband. As people all across Washington D.C. become infected and the insidious epidemic spreads, Carol must fight to protect herself and her son, who might just hold the key to stopping the escalating invasion.Produced by Joel Silver, and also starring Daniel Craig, Jeffrey Wright, and Veronica Cartwright, this edge-of-your-seat thriller makes its debut on 4K UHD with a wealth of new and archival extras.Product Features4K ULTRA HD BLU-RAY LIMITED EDITION CONTENTS4K (2160p) Ultra HD Blu-ray presentation in Dolby Vision (HDR10 compatible)Original lossless DTS-HD MA 5.1 audioOptional English subtitles for the deaf and hard of hearingBrand new audio commentary by film critics Andrea Subissati and Alexandra West, co-hosts of The Faculty of Horror podcastBody Snatchers and Beyond, a new visual essay by film scholar Alexandra Heller NicholasThat Bug That's Going Around, a new visual essay exploring The Invasion as pandemic prophecy by film scholar Josh NelsonWe've Been Snatched Before, an archival featurette from 2007The Invasion: A New Story, an archival featurette from 2007The Invasion: On the Set, an archival featurette from 2007The Invasion: Snatched, an archival featurette from 2007Theatrical trailerImage galleryIllustrated collector's booklet featuring new writing by film critics William Bibbiani and Sally ChristieReversible sleeve with original and newly commissioned artwork by Tommy PocketDouble-sided fold out poster featuring original and newly commissioned artwork by Tommy Pocket",

The two girls wind up in the company of escaped convict Krug (Garret Dillahunt) and his makeshift family of vile career criminals, who kidnap and brutally assault them before leaving them for dead.

The major studio follow-up Desperado sees Antonio Banderas take up the mantle of the mysterious Mariachi, stalking the Mexican underworld with enough bullets up his sleeves for every bandito in his path. Finally, 2003's Once Upon a Time in Mexico sees Rodriguez use every cutting-edge technological innovation in his arsenal to bring the trilogy's explosive conclusion to the screen, as the Mariachi finds himself in the center of a bloody war for the soul of Mexico itself.Fun, fast and full of invention and inspiration, this deadly trio cemented Robert Rodriguez's reputation as an action auteur worth following, and are accompanied here by insightful new interviews with the director and his crew of collaborators.Product FeaturesLIMITED EDITION CONTENTSHigh Definition (1080p) Region B Blu-ray presentations of all three films4K (2160p) Ultra HD Blu-ray presentation in Dolby Vision (HDR10 compatible) of DesperadoIllustrated collector's booklet featuring new writing by Carlos Aguilar and Nicholas ClementReversible sleeves featuring original and newly commissioned artwork by Paul ShipperDouble sided posters featuring original and newly commissioned artwork by Paul ShipperCollectable poster featuring Robert Rodriguez's original poster concept for El MariachiDISC 1 - EL MARIACHI (REGION B BLU-RAY)Original uncompressed Latin-American Spanish stereo audio, plus an English dub in lossless stereoOptional English subtitles, plus English subtitles for the deaf and hard-of-hearingCommentary by writer-director Robert RodriguezBig Vision Low Budget, a newly filmed interview with RodriguezThe Original Mariachi, a newly filmed interview with producer/star Carlos GallardoThe Music of 'El Mariachi', a newly produced featurette on the music in the film, featuring interviews with composers Eric Guthrie, Chris Knudson, Alvaro Rodriguez and Marc TrujilloTen Minute Film School, an archive featurette produced and narrated by RodriguezBedhead, a 1991 short film by RodriguezTheatrical trailer and TV spotDISCS 2 & 3 - DESPERADO (REGION B BLU-RAY / 4K ULTRA HD BLU-RAY)New 4K restoration from the original camera negative by Sony PicturesOriginal uncompressed stereo audio and DTS-HD MA 5.1 surround audioOptional English subtitles for the deaf and hard-of-hearingAudio commentary by writer-director Robert RodriguezLean and Mean, a newly filmed interview with RodriguezShoot Like Crazy, a newly filmed interview with producer Bill BordenKill Count, a newly filmed interview with stunt coordinator Steve DavisonLock and Load, a newly filmed interview with special effects coordinator Bob ShelleyGame Changer, a newly filmed appreciation by filmmaker Gareth Evans (The Raid)Ten More Minutes: Anatomy of a Shootout, an archive featurette narrated by RodriguezTextless opening (\"Morena de mi Corazón\")Theatrical trailersDISC 4 - ONCE UPON A TIME IN MEXICO (REGION B BLU-RAY)Original DTS-HD MA 5.1 surround and 2.0 stereo audioOptional English subtitles for the deaf and hard-of-hearingCommentary by writer-director Robert RodriguezThe Revolution Will Be Digitized, a newly filmed interview with RodriguezTroublemaking, a newly filmed interview with visual effects editor Ethan ManiquisEight deleted scenes, with optional commentary by RodriguezTen Minute Flick School, an archive featurette narrated by RodriguezInside Troublemaker Studios, an archive featurette on Rodriguez's studio in AustinTen Minute Cooking School, an archive featurette in which Rodriguez shows you how to cook Puerco PibilFilm is Dead: An Evening with Robert Rodriguez, a presentation by the director given in 2003The Anti-Hero's Journey, an archive featurette on the arc of the MariachiThe Good, the Bad and the Bloody: Inside KNB FX, an archive featurette on the film's special effectsTheatrical trailers",

    "description": "Arrow VideoWE ALL GO A LITTLE MAD SOMETIMES...Shattering expectations and shocking audiences around the world, Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho changed the face of cinema in 1960. It remains one of the most iconic and influential movies ever made.Twenty three years later, Australian filmmaker Richard Franklin (Patrick, Road Games) boldly followed in the master's footsteps and directed Psycho II, a sequel that not only delivered on the promise of his earlier films, but also lived up to Hitchcock's original. Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) is declared sane and released from the facility in which he was being held, despite the complaints of Lila Loomis (née Crane, Vera Miles) sister of Norman's most famous victim. All Norman wants to do is live quietly and productively as a normal member of society. But is returning to the house he once shared with his mother, and running the motel that was the site of so many murders, really a good idea? Is he cured, or will he kill again?Psycho III would see Anthony Perkins himself take the franchise's reins for his directorial debut, bringing a stylish flair that suggested his time working with not only Alfred Hitchcock, but Orson Welles and Ken Russell had been well spent. A fallen nun (Diana Scarwid as Maureen Coyle), a sleazy drifter (Jeff Fahey as Duane Duke), and a curious reporter looking for a scoop (Roberta Maxwell as Tracy Venables) all arrive at the Bates Motel and 'Mother' is less than happy, especially when Norman begins to fall in love. Meanwhile, Psycho IV: The Beginning, written by Joseph Stefano (screenwriter of the 1960 original) and directed by master of horror Mick Garris, returns to the primal scene to show us how it all began in Anthony Perkins' final franchise appearance. Rehabilitated and happily married, Norman Bates has finally escaped from the overbearing influence of his abusive mother. But his wife is pregnant, and Norman finds himself afraid that the child will inherit his mental illness.

The Mariner becomes embroiled with the Smokers, a gang of pirates who, led by villainous leader Deacon (Dennis Hopper, Blue Velvet), are seeking Enola (Tina Majorino, Napoleon Dynamite), a girl with a map to the mythical realm of Dryland tattooed on her back.Famous for both its epic scale and the controversy that swirled around its production, Waterworld is a key cult film of the 1990s, and an essential entry into the subgenre of ecologically-minded blockbusters.

    "description": "Arrow VideoBEYOND THE HORIZON LIES THE SECRET TO A NEW BEGINNINGThe most expensive film ever made at the time of its release, Waterworld has thrilled audiences through the years with its awe-inspiring Action & Adventure scenes, gargantuan maritime sets and ground-breaking special effects.A definitive post-apocalypse blockbuster, Waterworld stars Kevin Costner (The Untouchables) as The Mariner - a mutant trader, adrift in a dystopian future where Earth is submerged under water and humankind struggles to survive on boats and in ramshackle floating cities. The Mariner becomes embroiled with the Smokers, a gang of pirates who, led by villainous leader Deacon (Dennis Hopper, Blue Velvet), are seeking Enola (Tina Majorino, Napoleon Dynamite), a girl with a map to the mythical realm of Dryland tattooed on her back.Famous for both its epic scale and the controversy that swirled around its production, Waterworld is a key cult film of the 1990s, and an essential entry into the subgenre of ecologically-minded blockbusters. Presented here in an exclusive new restoration of the theatrical cut in 4K Ultra HD, alongside Blu-ray presentations of the TV and Ulysses cuts, and with a wealth of extra material, this high-water mark of high-concept Hollywood can now be enjoyed as never before.Product FeaturesThree cuts of the film newly restored from original film elements by Arrow FilmsOptional English subtitles for the deaf and hard of hearingSix collector's postcardsDouble-sided fold-out posterLimited edition 60-page perfect bound book featuring writing on the film by David J.

His fortunes are about to change dramatically, however, when one of the wealthiest students at his high school, sultry siren Kelly Van Ryan (Denise Richards), accuses him of rape. The charge looks sure to stick when another girl from the other end of the social spectrum, Suzie Toller (Neve Campbell), steps forward with her own allegations, but Detective Duquette (Kevin Bacon) smells something fishy, and the truth is as murky and dangerous as the alligator-infested swamps in the hinterlands of this affluent beach community.Presented in 4K restorations of its original theatrical version and extended 'Unrated Edition', Wild Things is a classic piece of sexy late-90s neo-noir from director John McNaughton and writer Stephen Peters, whose serpentine plotting will keep you on the edge of your seat until the end credits roll.Product Features4K restorations of both the Original Theatrical Version and the Unrated Edition from the original camera negatives by Sony Pictures Entertainment4K (2160p) UHD Blu-ray presentation in Dolby Vision (HDR10 compatible)Original uncompressed stereo audio and DTS-HD MA 5.1 surround audioOptional English subtitles for the deaf and hard-of-hearingExclusive audio commentary by director John McNaughton and producer Steven A.

Unable to go to the police without compromising the political career of his wife (Ann-Margret), he must take things into his own hands – and delve into a world of drugs, sleaze, pornography and snuff.Co-starring Prince protégé Vanity and John Glover (who was described as \"the best, most reprehensible villain of the year\" by Roger Ebert), and featuring a host of cameos from the stars of the 'Silver Age of Porn', 52 Pick-Up has been described by Leonard as his favourite big-screen adaptation of his works.Special FeaturesHigh Definition Blu-ray (1080p) and Standard Definition DVD presentation of the feature, transferred from original film elements by MGMOriginal Stereo 2.0 audio (uncompressed PCM on the Blu-ray)Optional English subtitles for the deaf and hard of hearingAudio commentary by critics Glenn Kenny and Doug Brod recorded exclusively for this releaseHardcore Cameos, a guide to the many cameo appearances by pornographic actors in 52 Pick-UpTheatrical trailerReversible sleeve featuring original and newly commissioned artwork by Reinhard Kleist",

During the chaos, three men are witnessed fleeing a burning pawnshop in the Hokkaido port town of Iwanai. The police suspect theft and arson, and when Detective Yumisaka (Junzaburo Ban) discovers the burned remains of a boat and the corpses of two men, he sets about tracking the shadowy third figure. Meanwhile, the mysterious Takichi Inukai (Rentaro Mikuni) takes shelter with a prostitute, Yae (Sachiko Hidari), a brief encounter that will come to define both of their lives. A decade later, long after the trail has gone cold, Yumisaka is called back by his successor Detective Ajimura (Ken Takakura) as two new dead bodies are found.Making its home video debut outside of Japan, this adaptation of Tsutomu Minakami's 1700-page novel is a landmark in master director Uchida's oeuvre. Its gritty monochrome photography has the immediacy of newsreel as Uchida uses the landscapes of postwar Japan to explore the massive social upheaval and unspoken legacies of the war, and create an unsettling karmic allegory of a man's struggle to escape his past sins.Product FeaturesHigh Definition Blu-ray (1080p) presentation of the restored 183 minute-long cut of the filmOriginal uncompressed mono audioOptional English subtitlesIntroduction by writer and curator Jasper SharpScene-specific commentaries from leading Japanese film scholars Aaron Gerow, Irene González-López, Erik Homenick, Earl Jackson, Daisuke Miyao and Alexander ZahltenOriginal theatrical trailerImage galleryTomu Uchida filmographyReversible sleeve featuring original and newly commissioned artwork by Tony Stella",

A parcel sent to her imprisoned husband is returned undelivered, prompting her to travel from her rural home to the remote region in Siberia where he is being held in the hope of an explanation.

    "description": "Arrow FilmsThe legendary, visionary Czech filmmaker Karel Zeman has been a profound influence on whole generations of filmmakers from Jan Svankmajer to Tim Burton, the Quay Brothers to Terry Gilliam. His ground-breaking innovations in the use of live-action and animation mark him as one of the great masters of 20th Century fantasy cinema. A Jester's Tale is one of his most renowned and celebrated achievements. Described by Zeman as a \"pseudo-historical\" film, it is a bold anti-war black comedy following the adventures of a plowboy and a mercenary, press-ganged into service on the battlefields of the Thirty Years War of 1618 - 1648.Co-scripted by Pavel Juracek (Ikarie XB1, Daisies, Josef Kilián), Karel Zeman's brilliant comic film with its melding of live-action and animation, extraordinary matte work along with Escher-inspired impossible constructions, anticipates Gilliam's Monty Python animations (not to mention 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail' and Gilliam's own 'Jabberwocky' and 'The Adventures of Baron Munchausen'). It also emerges as a sharp satire of war, human nature and of our very understanding of history itself.This dazzling feature is presented for the first time ever in the UK.Special FeaturesDocumentaryBooklet Essay",

    "description": "Arrow FilmsThe original Ringo films introduced another iconic hero to the spaghetti western; a clean-cut sharp shooter who was markedly different to Clint Eastwood's Man With No Name.In A Pistol For Ringo, the eponymous hero, played by Giuliano Gemma (Day of Anger, Tenebrae), infiltrates a ranch of Mexican bandits to save a beautiful hostage (Nieves Navarro, Death Walks on High Heels). In The Return Of Ringo, the gunslinger, now a veteran of war, disguises himself as a Mexican in order to take revenge on outlaws who have stolen his property and taken his wife.Hugely successful upon their original release, thanks in part to the skilled direction of Duccio Tessari (The Bloodstained Butterfly, Death Occurred Last Night), the Ringo films proved influential on the Italian western, spawning numerous unofficial sequels, due to their gripping set-pieces and unforgettable musical scoring by Ennio Morricone.

They connect as human beings, but they live more like friends than as lovers and lead nearly independent lives. Both seem comfortable with this coexistence, but the desires that lurk beneath its surface are brought out with the introduction of a third element into the equation. When Rinko receives a package of candid photographs of herself masturbating and the sender (played by Tsukamoto himself) contacts her with the threat of exposing them to her husband, she submits herself to the anonymous voyeur's sexual games. If she wishes to get hold of all the negatives and prints, Rinko is to comply with a set of assignments that place her constantly on the borderline between humiliation and pleasure - the voyeur knows exactly what Rinko's personal erotic fantasies are and makes her act them out one by one.",

Over the best part of 40 years Italian Maestro Sergio Martino has worked tirelessly in many genres of film and television. While his output is often diverse in tone and theme, one thing you can always guarantee is that his cinema is always entertaining.Author Kat Ellinger tracks the director's rise, from his humble beginnings as actor, production manager and second unit director, to his status as one of Italy's most celebrated cult filmmakers of the seventies and eighties. Chapters in the book include a run down of his earliest collaborations - with the likes of Mario Bava and Umberto Lenzi - and his first films, before turning to provide an in-depth examination of his giallo films. Later chapters focus on his crime thrillers, horror, sci-fi, action and adventure films; as well as delving into some of his most important partnerships; including those with his long-time producer, brother Luciano Martino, script-writer Ernesto Gastaldi and giallo and sexy comedy queen Edwige Fenech. In addition to this, the book takes a long look at some of the director's most overlooked films; including the massive contribution he made to the Italian sexy comedy and his major works for Italian television.Kat Ellinger is the Editor-in-Chief of Diabolique Magazine, and co-host of their Daughters of Darkness and Hell's Belles podcasts. She is also the author of Daughters of Darkness (Devil's Advocates Series, Auteur).Featuring new artwork by Gilles Vranckx and original stills.PAPERBACKAmount of pages: 91",

The result, America As Seen by a Frenchman, is a wide-eyed – perhaps even naïve – journey through a multitude of different Americas, filtered through a French sensibility and serving as a fascinating exploration of a culture that is both immediately familiar and thoroughly alien.Prison rodeos; Miss America pageants; visits to Disneyland and a school for striptease; a town inhabited solely by twins; rows of newborns in incubators, like products on an assembly line – all these weird and wondrous sights, and more, are captured, sans jugement, by Reichenbach's camera, aided by whimsical narration (provided by, among others, Jean Cocteau) and a jaunty musical score by the late, great Michel Legrand (Une femme est une femme).Titled L'Amérique insolite – literally \"unusual America\" – in its native tongue, America As Seen by a Frenchman lovingly renders the various eccentricities of Americana circa the mid-twentieth century, and proves the old adage that reality really is stranger than fiction.Special FeaturesHigh Definition (1080p) Blu-ray™ presentationOriginal uncompressed mono audioNewly translated English subtitlesNew video appreciation of the film by author and critic Philip KempImage galleryReversible sleeve featuring original and newly commissioned artwork by Ignatius Fitzpatrick",

    "description": "Arrow FilmsEveryone knows the classic American horror films. Night of the Living Dead, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre and A Nightmare on Elm Street, to name but a few. But we want to tell you a different story: a story of the unsung heroes of stars-and-stripes terror, films that have remained on the fringes of the genre either through lack of availability or else sheer obscurity. This is where American Horror Project comes in.Volume One of this series presents three tales of violence and madness from the 1970s. Malatesta's Carnival of Blood (Christopher Speeth, 1973) sees a family arrive at a creepy, dilapidated fairground in search of their missing son, only to find themselves at the mercy of cannibalistic ghouls lurking beneath the park. Meanwhile, The Witch Who Came from the Sea (Matt Cimber, 1976), stars Millie Perkins (The Diary of Anne Frank) as a young woman whose bizarre and violent fantasies start to bleed into reality – literally. Lastly, every parent's worst nightmare comes true in The Premonition (Robert Allen Schnitzer, 1976), a tale of psychic terror in which five-year-old Janie is snatched away by a strange woman claiming to be her long-lost mother.Remastered from the best surviving elements and contextualised with extensive supplementary material, American Horror Project proudly presents an alternative history of American horror and film heritage.3-DISC SPECIAL EDITION CONTENTS2K restorations of the three featuresHigh Definition Blu-ray™ (1080p) presentationsOriginal uncompressed mono 1.0 audioEnglish subtitles for the deaf and hard of hearingReversible sleeve featuring original and newly commissioned artwork by the Twins of EvilMALATESTA'S CARNIVAL OF BLOODIntroduction to the film by Stephen ThrowerAudio commentary by film historian Richard Harland SmithThe Secrets of Malatesta – an interview with director Christopher SpeethCrimson Speak – an interview with writer Werner LiepoltMalatesta's Underground – art directors Richard Strange and Alan Johnson discuss the weird, mysterious world of Malatesta's undergroundOuttakesDraft script (BD-ROM content)Stills galleryTHE WITCH WHO CAME FROM THE SEAIntroduction to the film by Stephen ThrowerAudio commentary with director Matt Cimber, actress Millie Perkins and director of photography Dean CundeyTides and Nightmares – making-of documentary featuring interviews with Cimber, Parkins, Cundey and actor John GoffA Maiden's Voyage – archive featurette comprising interviews with Cimber, Perkins and CundeyLost at Sea – director Matt Cimber reflects on his notorious cult classicTHE PREMONITIONIntroduction to the film by Stephen ThrowerIsolated scoreAudio commentary with director-producer Robert Allen SchnitzerPictures from a Premonition – making-of documentary featuring interviews Schnitzer, composer Henry Mollicone and cinematographer Victor MiltArchive Interview with star Richard LynchThree Robert Allen Schnitzer short films: 'Vernal Equinox', 'Terminal Point' and 'A Rumbling in the Land'4 Peace SpotsTrailers and TV spots",

    "description": "Arrow FilmsContinuing its mission to unearth the very best in weird and wonderful horror obscura from the golden age of US independent genre moviemaking, Arrow Films is proud to present the second volume in its American Horror Project series co-curated by author Stephen Thrower (Nightmare USA: The Untold Story of the Exploitation Independents).Starting off with a little-seen 1970 offering from underrated cult auteur John Hayes (Grave of the Vampire, Garden of the Dead), Dream No Evil is a haunting, moving tale of a young woman's desperate quest to be reunited with her long-lost father – only to find herself drawn into a fantasyland of homicidal madness. Meanwhile, 1976's Dark August stars Academy Award winner Kim Hunter (A Streetcar Named Desire) in a story of a man pursued by a terrifying and deadly curse in the wake of a hit-and-run accident. Lastly, 1977's Harry Novak-produced The Child is a gloriously delirious slice of horror mayhem in which a young girl raises an army of the dead against the people she holds responsible for her mother's death.With all three films having been remastered from the best surviving film elements and appearing here alongside a wealth of supplementary material, American Horror Project Volume Two offers up yet another fascinating and blood-chilling foray into the deepest, darkest corners of stars-and-stripes terror.3-DISC SPECIAL EDITION CONTENTS2K restorations from original film elementsHigh Definition Blu-ray presentationOriginal uncompressed PCM mono audioEnglish subtitles for the deaf and hard of hearingReversible sleeves featuring original and newly-commissioned artwork by The Twins of EvilDREAM NO EVILFilmed appreciation by Stephen ThrowerAudio commentary with Kat Ellinger and Samm DeighanHollywood After Dark: The Early Films of John Hayes, 1959-1971 – video essay by Stephen Thrower looking at Hayes' filmography leading up to Dream No EvilWriter Chris Poggiali on the prodigious career of celebrated character actor Edmond O'BrienExcerpts from an audio interview with actress Rue McClanahan (The Golden Girls) discussing her many cinematic collaborations with director John HayesDARK AUGUSTFilmed appreciation by Stephen ThrowerAudio commentary with writer-director Martin GoldmanOn-camera interview with Martin GoldmanOn-camera interview with producer Marianne KanterThe Hills Are Alive: Dark August and Vermont Folk Horror – author and artist Stephen R.

Whilst coming to terms with her refusal, Heinrich meets Henriette (Birte Schnöink), the wife of a business acquaintance. The beautiful young woman is at first mystified by his perplexing offer, but she acquiesces when she is diagnosed with a terminal illness.Austrian auteur Jessica Hausner deconstructs the traditional tropes of romance and comedy in this wry but profound chamber piece which was lauded by the critics, and is presented here on DVD and Blu-ray with with an array of contextualising extras including an interview and audio commentary with the director.Special FeaturesHigh Definition (1080p) Blu-ray PresentationOriginal 5.1 surround soundOptional English subtitlesAudio commentary by director Jessica HausnerInterview with Jessica HausnerDeleted scenesHausner's short film Oida about the musical duo AttwengerTheatrical trailerReversible sleeve featuring two artwork options",

    "description": "Arrow FilmsMaster filmmaker Robert Wise began his career with horror classics The Curse of the Cat People and The Body Snatcher for producer Val Lewton. His career would go on to include westerns, thrillers, science fiction and musicals, earning him two Academy Awards for Best Director. In 1963 he returned to his Lewtonian roots with the classic ghost story The Haunting; In 1977 he returned once more with the supernatural thriller Audrey Rose.All Bill and Jane Templeton wish for is a quiet, peaceful life with their 11-year-old daughter Ivy. But their dreams turn to nightmares as Ivy is besieged first by terrifying 'memories' of events that never occurred... and then by a mysterious stranger who stalks her every move, and claims that Ivy was in fact his daughter in another life.Released in the wake of The Exorcist and The Omen, Audrey Rose is an intelligent, heartfelt drama that approaches its subject with an open mind and seriousness of intent that caught many off guard but typifies Wise's previous genre forays. Sensitively played by a sterling cast at the top of their game, this underseen gem deserves a place on the shelf of any fan of classic horror.Product FeaturesBrand new 2K restoration by Arrow Films from a new 4K scan of the original 35mm camera negativeHigh Definition (1080p) Blu-Ray presentationOriginal lossless mono audioOptional English subtitles for the deaf and hard of hearingBrand new audio commentary by film critic Jon TowlsonFaith and Fraud, a brand new interview with magician Adam Cardone about reincarnation and belief in Audrey RoseThen and Now, a brand new featurette looking at the New York locations used in the filmI've Been Here Before, archive visual essay by Lee Gambin looking at reincarnation in cinemaInvestigator: The Paranormal World of Frank De Felitta, an archive interview with the author and scriptwriter of Audrey RoseThe Role of a Mother, an archive Interview with Marsha MasonHypnotist: Inside the score for Audrey Rose, an archive interview with film music historian Daniel SchweigerTheatrical trailerImage galleryReversible sleeve featuring original and newly commissioned artwork by Christopher ShyFIRST PRESSING ONLY: fully illustrated collectors booklet featuring new writing by critics Kimberly Lindbergs and Johnny Mains",

In this \"sincerely disturbing\" (Indiewire) debut from co-writer/director Andres Torres, a slow-witted misfit named Albert (Jon Wachter, giving what HorrorNews calls \"the best male performance in a horror film this year\") sells hot dogs all night from the most unsanitary food cart in downtown Manhattan. But when he's invited to become the new model for a manipulative fetish photographer, Albert will be exposed to a seething city underbelly where desire masquerades as perversion and depravity poses as art. It may shock you. You might even be appalled.

    "title": "Battles Without Honor and Humanity | The Complete Collection | Blu-ray",
    "price": "£50.00",
    "description": "Arrow FilmsKinji Fukasaku (Battle Royale) gave the world Japan's answer to The Godfather with this violent yakuza saga, influencing filmmakers from Quentin Tarantino (Kill Bill, Reservoir Dogs) to Takashi Miike (Graveyard of Honor, Audition). Made within just two years, the five-film series brought a new kind of realism and ferocity to the crime genre in Japan, revitalising the industry and leading to unprecedented commercial and critical success.Literally exploding on screen with a mushroom cloud, and ending with Hiroshima's A-bomb Dome, the epic story of Battles Without Honour and Humanity follows over 100 characters through twenty years of gang wars, alliances, betrayals, and assassinations, in an exciting exploration of criminal power and politics in Japan. In the opening episode, ex-soldier Shôzô Hirono escapes from the post-war black markets to become a key member of the Yamamori gang, but soon finds himself disillusioned by the selfish duplicity of his bosses. Hiroshima Death Match focuses on a demobilised kamikaze pilot drifting through the early 1950s, whose suicidal impulses find good use as a mob assassin. Proxy War and Police Tactics form a labyrinthine, two-part story of ambition and betrayal set against Japan's rapid economic growth of the 1960s, with Shôzô caught between warring factions. Final Episode concludes the series in the 1970s as the former Yamamori gang transforms itself into an economic conglomerate called the Tensei Group, in a bid for mainstream respectability.Fukasaku and his team broke with the longstanding studio tradition of casting marquee idols as honourable, kimono-clad heroes, defending their gang bosses against unscrupulous villains, and instead adapted true accounts torn from the headlines, shot in a documentary-like style, and with few clear-cut heroes or villains. The vibrancy and dynamism of the filmmaking, plus its shocking violence, Shakespearean plotlines, and wide tapestry of characters, launched a revolutionary new genre, establishing the series as one of the great masterpieces of world crime cinema.Special FeaturesHigh Definition Blu-ray™ (1080p) presentation of all five original filmsOriginal Mono audio (uncompressed PCM on the Blu-rays)Optional English subtitles for all five filmsReversible sleeves featuring newly commissioned artwork by Reinhard KleistDisc 1: Battles Without Honor and HumanityAudio commentary by critic and author Stuart Galbraith IVYakuza Graveyard – an interview with Takashi Miike about Kinji Fukasaku and the yakuza film genreOriginal trailers for all five filmsDisc 2: Hiroshima Death MatchMan of Action – an interview with series fight choreographer Ryūzō UenoOriginal TrailerDisc 3: Proxy WarSecrets of the Piranha Army – a documentary about the troupe of supporting actors who appeared throughout the series, featuring interviews with original Piranha members Masaru Shiga and Takashi Noguchi, plus second-generation Piranha, Takashi Nishina and Akira MurotaTales of a Bit Player – an interview with supporting actor and stuntman Seizô FukumotoOriginal TrailerDisc 4: Police TacticsRemembering Kinji – a featurette about director Kinji Fukasaku and his work, featuring interviews with Kenta Fukasaku and film critic and Fukasaku biographer Sadao YamaneFukasaku Family – an interview with Proxy War and Police Tactics assistant director Tôru DobashiOriginal TrailerDisc 5: Final EpisodeLast Days of the Boss – an interview with Final Episode screenwriter Kôji TakadaOriginal poster gallery for the seriesOriginal Trailer",

Light years from Disney, Herz's Beauty and the Beast (also known more provocatively as The Virgin and the Monster) follows the familiar story - innocent girl presents herself as sacrifice to a cursed man-beast hiding in exile, and learns to live with, and eventually love her captor - but is transformed into something entirely more twisted and terrifying in Herz's macabre re-imagining.Aided by wonderful set and costume design, superb cinematography and evocative score, this is a fairy-tale-turned-horror story from Czechoslovak cinema's most wryly subversive artist.\"Herz's richly crafted retelling […] is definitely no children's movie - but it is, with its arresting lyricism and striking style, an eminently worthy rival to the classic 1946 version by Jean Cocteau.\" Nick Pinkerton, Metrograph\"Perhaps the most beauteous film ever that's drawn from fairy-tale material... this is a very dark film that is also warm, sensuous and mysterious.\" Dennis GrunesAwards:1978 Sitges Film Festival / Winner: Best Director1978 Fantasporto Festival / Winner: Jury PrizeSpecial FeaturesBeauty and the Beast (Panna a netvor, 1978) presented complete and uncut from a new HD transfer from original materials by the Czech National Film ArchiveA newly-recorded Projection Booth audio commentary with Mike White, Samm Deighan and Kat EllingerFrantišek Hrubín (1964): a short film on the Czech writer and poet, and co-screenwriter of Beauty and the Beast20-page booklet with new writing on the film by author Jonathan OwenNew and improved English subtitle translationRegion free Blu-ray (A/B/C)",

    "description": "Arrow FilmsMartin Beck is one of Nordic Noir's first and definitive Scandinavian detectives epitomising the good-cop bad-cop routine alongside his petulant partner, Gunvald Larsson. Based on the characters of the hugely popular Martin Beck detective series of novels by Swedish husband-and-wife writers Maj Sjöwall and Per Wahlöö, Beck sees the much-loved detective brought to life on the small screen. Beck is arguably the originator of what has become known as Nordic Noir.This collection of five feature-length films (Four from the latest season and one from the previous, the latter receiving a theatrical release in Sweden) sees detective Martin Beck investigating the shocking death of a young woman found strangled in a hotel room, a gangster kingpin executed by a sniper in front of his family, a terrorist attack and a suspicious hospital death which sourly turns out to be premeditated murder. It's an intricate web of characters and lies and the killer is never who you expect it to be.Starring Peter Haber (The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo) as Beck and Mikael Persbrandt (The Hobbit: The Desolation Of Smaug, Salvation and The Hypnotist) as Larsson, the drama's combination of complex woven details of police detection and beautifully realised characters combined with twisting, masterful storylines has ensured that the award-winning series won fans and acclaim from around the world.",

    "description": "Arrow FilmsProlific Japanese filmmaker Kiyoshi Kurosawa (Pulse) returned to Cannes with this genre-bending mashup, both a darkly comedic sci-fi and a slow-paced action spectacle.Three aliens on a reconnaissance mission to Earth take over the bodies of human hosts to explore the world they re about to invade. On the way they steal individual concepts from the minds of anyone who crosses their path, from work, to free will, to love, leaving behind them a trail of soulless bodies. In doing so they start to unwittingly define the essential aspects of what it means to be human. The film follows Narumi (Masami Nagasawa, I Wish), whose husband, Shinji (Ryuhei Matsuda), becomes one of the three hosts. As the invasion grows nearer, Narumi s attempts to save humanity from extinction become increasingly entwined with Shinji s decision on whether to save the humanity within himself.Combining the best of Kurosawa s genre stylings with his forays into dark family dramas, Before We Vanish sees the director delivering a twist on the classic Invasion of the Body Snatchers narrative by recontextualising it in a disconnected modern world. Presenting a unique vision to how invasions have been portrayed in popular culture in the past it asks the question, how much is humanity worth, if we ve become too alienated to be able to recongnise the aliens among us?Special FeaturesHigh Definition Blu-ray (1080p) presentationOriginal 7.1 DTS-HD Master AudioOptional English subtitlesThe Making Of Before We Vanish, an 53-minute featurette including on-set footage and interviews with cast and crewInside The Story and Inside The Characters, two featurettes with cast and crew interviewsLooking Back, members of the cast reunite to discuss memories of the productionRed carpet interviews from the Cannes Film Festival premiereCast and crew Q&As from four screenings including the Japanese premiereTrailerReversible sleeve featuring original and newly commissioned artwork by Tommy Pocket",

Director E J-yong, commissioned to make a promo for a new smartphone, has the idea of making it the world's first film directed remotely via internet link-ups rather than in person on set. While she is still shooting Im Sang-soo's The Taste of Money, he invites veteran actress Yun Yeo-jeong to take the lead role alongside a cast of other well-known actors. As the cast assembles in the studio, E addresses them on an internet link from Los Angeles, saying he needs the help of all his friends for him to break into Hollywood. The film, How To Fall In Love In Ten Minutes, is to be shot in only two days and will be only 10 minutes long. Some are excited to be part of the experiment, others are more dubious. As everyone struggles with the process and mounting technical problems, people start listening to E less and less, and an air of mutiny starts to spread through the disgruntled set.Special Features5.1 Surround Sound Anamorphic Widescreen with Removable SubtitlesInterviews with Cast and Crew",

Working as a file clerk at LesterCorp (hidden away on Floor 7½ of the Mertin-Flemmer Building), and spending most of his time lusting after aloof co-worker Maxine (Catherine Keener), one day Craig makes an incredible discovery: a hidden door that leads to a portal inside the mind of legendary actor John Malkovich (John Malkovich), seeing life through his eyes for fifteen minutes before being spat back out on the New Jersey Turnpike. Craig shares his find with Lotte and Maxine, leading to an explosive chain of events that will irrevocably alter the lives of all three... and of course, the unwitting Malkovich.Product FeaturesRestored from a 4K scan of the original camera negative and approved by director Spike JonzeHigh Definition Blu-Ray (1080p) presentationOriginal 5.1 DTS-HD master audioOptional English subtitles for the deaf and hard of hearingSelect scene audio commentary by Jonze's friend and competitor, the filmmaker Michel GondryAll Noncombatants Please Clear The Set, a behind-the-scenes documentary by filmmaker Lance BangsJohn Malkovich on 'Being John Malkovich', a conversation between the film’s star and actor, writer and humourist John HodgmanIllusion of Life, a new featurette looking at the marionette sequences in the film, including newly uncovered behind-the-scenes footage and exclusive interviews with puppeteer Phillip Huber and puppeteers/designers/fabricators Kamela Portuges and Lee ArmstrongSpike's Photos, an interview with the director where he discusses his on-set photosThe 7½ Floor, the full corporate orientation video seen in the filmJohn Horatio Malkovich: Dance of Despair and Disillusionment, the full pseudo-documentary seen in the filmAn Interview with Director Spike Jonze, a brief chat with the director filmed under duress by Lance BangsAn Intimate Portrait of the Art of Puppeteering, a short archival interview with Phillip Huber filmed in 1999 by BangsAn Intimate Portrait of the Art of Background Driving, an on-set look at filming the New Jersey Turnpike sequence by BangsDon't Enter Here, There Is Nothing HereTheatrical trailer and TV spotsImage galleryReversible sleeve featuring original and newly commissioned artwork by Vero Navarro",

As innocent as her name suggests, Blanche becomes the unwilling centre of attention in a power struggle between her husband, the visiting King and his page, the latter a notorious womaniser. Its unique visual style resembles a medieval fresco, and its period-instruments soundtrack, adapting the ancient 'Carmina Burana' song book, was years ahead of its time.Blanche is presented in a brand new high-definition restoration from original 35mm elements.Special FeaturesNew high definition digital transfers of the feature and the shortsUncompressed Mono 2.0 PCM AudioOptional English subtitles where necessaryIntroduction by Schalcken the Painter director Leslie MegaheyBallad of Imprisonment, a documentary about the film featuring producer Dominique Duvergé-Ségrétin, assistant director André Heinrich, camera operator Noël Véry and assistant Patrice LeconteObscure Pleasures: A Portrait of Walerian Borowczyk, a newly edited archival interview in which Borowczyk discusses painting, cinema and sexGunpoint, a documentary short by Peter Graham produced and edited by BorowczykReversible sleeve featuring original poster designs",

Her kidnapper introduces himself as Michio (Eiji Funakoshi), a blind sculptor whom she had witnessed previously at an exhibition in which she featured intently caressing a statue of her naked torso. Michio announces his intention of using her to sculpt the perfect female form. At first defiant, she eventually succumbs to his intense fixation on her body and finds herself drawn into his sightless world, in which touch is everything.Blind Beast is a masterpiece of erotic horror that explores the all-encompassing and overwhelming relationship between the artist and his art and the obsessive closed world that the artist inhabits, with maestro director Yasuzo Masumura (Giants and Toys, Irezumi) conjuring up a hallucinogenic dreamworld in which sensual and creative urges combine with a feverish intensity.Special FeaturesHigh Definition Blu-ray (1080p) presentationOriginal uncompressed Japanese mono audioOptional English subtitlesBrand new audio commentary by Asian cinema scholar Earl JacksonNewly filmed introduction by Japanese cinema expert Tony RaynsBlind Beast: Masumura the Supersensualist, a brand new visual essay by Japanese literature and visual studies scholar Seth JacobowitzOriginal TrailerImage GalleryReversible sleeve featuring original and newly commissioned artwork by Tony Stella",

Meanwhile, in 1978's The Coming of Sin (La Visita del Vicio, in its native Spanish), a young gypsy girl experiences a violent sexual awakening as her dreams of a naked young man on horseback become reality.By turns terrifying, titillating, artful and scandalous, these three films assembled here collectively offer film fans a unique perspective on the fascinating, highly-varied career of one of the horror genre's most overlooked auteurs.SPECIAL EDITION CONTENTSThree films by José Ramón Larraz: Whirlpool, Vampyres and The Coming of Sin, restored in 2K from original film elementsEnglish subtitles for the deaf and hard-of-hearing for all featuresNewly commissioned artwork by Gilles VranckxWHIRLPOOL (1970)Original US Theatrical CutAudio commentary with Tim LucasObsessive Recurrence: The Early Films of José Larraz – author and critic Kim Newman reflects on the recurring themes and underlying obsessions linking together the early productions of José LarrazA Curious Casting – actor Larry Dann on the strange story behind his casting in WhirlpoolDeviations of Whirlpool – featurette comparing the differences between the US Theatrical Cut and a previously circulated, alternate cut of the filmVivian Neves interviewed by Michael Parkinson on BBC's Parkinson, originally broadcast in July 1972Extract from an archival interview with José LarrazImage GalleryOriginal US Theatrical TrailerVAMPYRES (1974)Full Uncut VersionAudio commentary with Kat EllingerInterviews withproducer Brian Smedley-Aston, actors Marianne Morris, Anulka, Brian Deacon, Sally Faulkner, makeup artist Colin Arthur and composer James Kenelm ClarkeReimagining Vampyres – an interview with Larraz's friend and collaborator Victor Matellano, director of the 2015 Vampyres remakeExtract from an archival interview with José LarrazJosé Larraz and Marianne Morris Q&A at 1997 EurofestImage GalleryTrailersTHE COMING OF SIN (1978)Spanish and English language versions of the featureAudio commentary with Kat Ellinger and Samm DeighanVariations of Vice: The Alternate Versions of The Coming of Sin – exploitation expert Marc Morris on the strange and scandalous release history of José Larraz's most censored filmRemembering Larraz – author and filmmaker Simon Birrell shares his fond and extensive memories of his long-time friend and collaborator José LarrazHis Last Request (2005, 27 mins) – short film by Simon Birrell made under the guidance of José Larraz and starring Spanish horror legend Jack TaylorExtract from an archival interview with José LarrazImage GalleryOriginal Spanish Trailer",

He's approached by Maeda, a low-ranking member of a local yakuza group, to take out a rival gang boss. But the sudden arrival into his life of a spirited young woman, Keiko (Yumiko Nogawa, Gate of Flesh), has dramatic ramifications on his relationship with his new employer. Ichikawa's lone wolf assassin is back in A Killer's Key, this time masquerading as a traditional dance instructor named Nitta who is called in to avert a potential financial scandal that threatens to engulf a powerful yakuza group with ties to powerful figures in the political establishment.Co-scripted by the director Yasuzō Masumura (Giants and Toys, Blind Beast) and featuring masterful scope cinematography with an expressionistic eye for colour by one of Japan's most esteemed cinematographers, Kazuo Miyagawa (Rashomon, Ugetsu), these Japanese crime drama essentials are presented for the very first time to the English-language home video market.Product FeaturesLIMITED EDITION CONTENTSHigh Definition (1080p) Blu-ray presentation of both filmsOriginal uncompressed Japanese mono audio for both filmsOptional newly translated English subtitlesBrand new audio commentary for both films by critic and Asian cinema expert Tony RaynsThe Definite Murderer, a brand new 30-minute introduction to the films by Japanese film scholar Mark RobertsOriginal theatrical trailers for both filmsImage galleryReversible sleeve featuring newly commissioned artwork for both films by Tony StellaIllustrated collectors booklet featuring new writing on the films by Jasper Sharp and Earl Jackson",

Cannily realising there's money to be made from playing each side against the other, the Man with No Name soon finds himself caught in the crossfire as the body count escalates, his only chance of escape a standoff against the Rojos' mercilessly cruel leader, Ramón (Gian Maria Volonté).Leone's clever and contemporary inversion of Western archetypes was not only the first entry in a much-beloved trilogy, but the director's first collaboration with the brilliant composer Ennio Morricone.

    "price": "£55.00",
    "description": "In the mid-1960s, the runaway success of Sergio Leone's \"Dollars\" trilogy gave rise to an explosion of similar productions. Filmmakers by the dozen sought to capitalize on this new, uniquely Italian take on the western, which was characterized by their deeply cynical outlook, morally compromised antiheroes and unflinching depictions of savage violence. This specially curated selection gathers four outstanding examples of the genre from the height of its popularity, all centred around the theme of blood money.In Romolo Guerrieri's $10,000 Blood Money (1967; aka $10,000 for a Massacre), Gianni Garko - best known for his portrayal of supernatural gunslinger Sartana - takes on the part of another beloved western antihero, Django, who is on the trail of bandit Manuel Vasquez (Claudio Camaso, A Bay of Blood). But what started as a job for hire soon turns personal, with Django swearing vengeance against the unscrupulous outlaw. Then, in the film's spiritual successor, Giovanni Fago's Vengeance is Mine (1967; aka $100,000 for a Killing), Garko and Camaso once again lead the cast, this time as estranged half-brothers - one a Confederate soldier now riding with renegade outlaws, the other a bounty hunter tasked with bringing him in alive.Next, in Giuliano Carnimeo's Find a Place to Die (1968), Jeffrey Hunter (The Searchers) plays Joe Collins, a disgraced former soldier who assembles a ragtag band of scoundrels. They are lured into helping a woman (Pascale Petit, A Queen for Caesar) to rescue her prospector husband, who is trapped at their gold mine cave-in - though in reality, they have designs on the gold strike themselves. Finally, in Cesare Canevari's psychedelic Matalo! (Kill Him) (1970), double- and triple-crosses abound as a band of outlaws, having holed up in an isolated ghost town, set about terrorizing travellers Ray (Lou Castel, Orgasmo) and Bridget (Ana María Mendoza, 7 Women for the MacGregors) - only to get more than they bargained for when Ray fights back, armed only with his weapon of choice: a bag full of boomerangs.Featuring a wealth of key Euro-cult talent both behind and in front of the camera, Arrow Films is proud to present these four classic westerns in sparkling High Definition restorations alongside a plethora of brand new bonus materials.SPECIAL EDITION CONTENTSHigh Definition Blu-ray (1080p) presentations of all four filmsBrand new 2K restorations of all four films from the original 35mm camera negatives by Arrow FilmsOriginal Italian and English front and end titlesRestored lossless original Italian and English soundtracksEnglish subtitles for the Italian soundtracksEnglish subtitles for the deaf and hard of hearing for the English soundtracksBrand new introductions to each film by journalist and critic Fabio MelelliGalleries for all four filmsReversible sleeves featuring original artwork and a slipcover featuring newly commissioned artwork by Gilles VranckxDISC 1 - $10,000 BLOOD MONEYAudio commentary by film historian Lee BroughtonTears of Django - featurette with archival interviews with director Romolo Guerrieri and actor Gianni GarkoThe Producer Who Didn't Like Western Movies - interview with producer Mino LoyHow the West Was Won - interview with screenwriter Ernesto GastaldiTheatrical trailerDISC 2 - VENGEANCE IS MINEAudio commentary by critic Adrian J.

At once epic and intimate, it is a one-of-a-kind trip through the exhilaration of childhood, the seismic shifts of modern family life, and the passage of time itself.Dreamy-eyed grade-schooler Mason (Ellar Coltrane) is facing upheaval: his struggling single mom Olivia (Patricia Arquette) has decided to move him and older sister Samantha (Lorelei Linklater) to Houston - just as their long-absent father Mason Sr. (Ethan Hawke) re-enters their world. Thus begins a decade of constantly unfolding heartbreak and wonder. Against the tide of family moves and controversies, faltering marriages and re-marriages, new schools, first loves, lost loves, good times and scary times that will shape him, Mason emerges to find his own road in life.A remarkable achievement that builds on Linklater's fascination with time, relationships and the ever-changing nature of our lives, Boyhood is a deeply moving experience that found praise from critics around the world and went on to win the award for Best Film at both the Golden Globes and British Academy Film Awards in 2015.Product FeaturesSPECIAL EDITION CONTENTSHigh Definition Blu-ray (1080p) presentationLossless DTS HD MA 5.1 audioOptional English subtitles for the deaf and hard of hearingWithout Ambition, One Starts Nothing, a featurette featuring American poet and critic Dan Chiasson in conversation with his son Louis Chiasson about their shared love and connection to the filmIn Search of Lost Time, a visual essay by critic and film-maker Scout TafoyaBefore and After Boyhood, an interview with Richard Linklater by film critic Rob Stone, author of Walk, Don't Run: The Cinema of Richard LinklaterRichard Linklater at the BFI, director Richard Linklater discusses Boyhood and his whole career in this on stage appearance at the British Film InstituteTheatrical trailerImage gallery",

    "title": "Bruce Lee at Golden Harvest Limited Edition",
    "price": "£110.00",
    "description": "Arrow VideoWhen former child actor and Hollywood TV sidekick Bruce Lee returned to his native Hong Kong in 1971 to star in two films for fledgling company Golden Harvest, movie history was made thanks to one of the most iconic partnerships between star and studio that cinema has ever seen. In only a handful of films, Lee high-kicked his way into audiences’ imaginations forever, thanks to his blistering screen presence and his masterful ‘Jeet Kune Do’ fighting technique.The first two starring vehicles for Lee, The Big Boss and Fist of Fury (both directed by Lo Wei), smashed all box office records in Hong Kong and made him the most famous face on the continent. Lee asserted his artistic independence by directing, writing and starring in The Way of the Dragon, arguably his most thrilling and personal film. Tragically, on the cusp of achieving the international stardom he had long strived for, Bruce Lee died suddenly in 1973, aged only 32. Not to be outdone by the tidal wave of ‘Bruceploitation’ films that followed, Golden Harvest completed two posthumous films using unreleased footage, 1978’s Game of Death and its 1981 sequel, as well as two official documentaries, the first of which hit cinemas only three months after Lee’s death. Today, five decades since his passing, Bruce Lee continues to be the most beloved and influential martial artist in the world.This definitive collection, featuring fresh and exclusive 4K restorations by Arrow Video from the best available film materials, hours of brand new bonus features and previously unreleased footage - including the extended Mandarin Cut of The Big Boss, now ten minutes longer than any version ever released on video worldwide, and the never-before-seen ‘log fight’ from the original Game of Death shoot - is the ultimate tribute to Bruce Lee’s enduring legacy and fruitful collaboration with Golden Harvest.LIMITED TEN-DISC BLU-RAY COLLECTION CONTENTSLimited edition packaging featuring newly commissioned artwork by Tony Stella200-page hardbound book featuring new writing by Walter Chaw, Henry Blyth, Andrew Staton, Dylan Cheung, David West and James FlowerTwenty-four lobby card reproductionsTen glossy photos of Lee in actionReversible poster with vintage quad poster artworkDISC ONE - THE BIG BOSSHigh Definition (1080p) Blu-ray presentation of the 99-minute 1983 version of The Big Boss, newly restored by Arrow Films from the original negativeOriginal newly restored lossless Mandarin, English and Cantonese mono audioTwo English mono options, the standard mix and a Japanese mix with alternate scoreNewly translated English subtitles, plus optional subtitles for the deaf and hard-of-hearing for the English dubsTwo brand new feature commentaries, one by David Desser and one by Brandon BentleyReturn to Thailand, a new documentary produced and presented by Matt Routledge exploring the original filming locationsNewly uncovered deleted and extended scenes, with optional commentary by BentleyThe Not-Quite-Biggest Boss, a video essay by Bentley investigating the scenes still lost, such as the ‘saw-in-the-head’ sceneArchive interviews with co-star Lau Wing and stuntman Tung WaiBruce Lee Vs.

    "description": "GUESS WHAT'S ON THE MENU? YOU ARE!The Krites have landed! Carnivorous creatures from outer space! Vicious vermin with very sharp teeth! The beloved sci-fi/comedy-horror franchise makes its UK Blu-ray debut in this special edition box set from Arrow Video.A smart homage to 1950's B-movies, Critters sees a group of small but toothy extra terrestrials escape from an alien prison and land in small-town America with two shape-shifting bounty hunters in hot pursuit. Directed by Stephen Herek (Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure) and starring genre stalwarts Dee Wallace (The Howling) and M. Emmet Walsh (Blood Simple), the film was a smash-hit on home video, launching a franchise for the ravenous furry fiends. Two years later, Critters 2: The Main Course sees the Krites come back for seconds as leftover eggs hatch and attack the rural town of Grover's Bend. Directed by Mick Garris (Sleepwalkers) with a script co-written by David Twohy (Pitch Black), Critters 2 is one big ball of toothy delight.Celebrated horror author and screenwriter David J. Schow (The Crow) comes aboard for Critters 3, bringing the Krites to the big city. Marking the feature film debut of none other than Leonardo DiCaprio (Django Unchained), it was shot simultaneously with the darker, less comedic Critters 4, in which the ferocious furballs battle series stalwart Charlie (Don Opper, Android) in outer space, featuring a cast that includes Angela Bassett (Strange Days) and Brad Dourif (Child's Play).A four course feast of fun, fur, fear and fangs, served with a platter of new and archive extras to whet your appetite!

Taking a job as a casino croupier just to make ends meet, he finds himself seduced by the high stakes world of luck and chance. As the job takes over his life and his relationship to girlfriend Marion (Gina McKee) begins to crumble, Jack's attention is caught by down-on-her-luck gambler Jani (Alex Kingston). Under pressure from her creditors, she asks Jack to be the inside man for a planned heist at the casino. It all sounds so easy. But even a pro can't predict which cards will be dealt.With a screenplay by Paul Mayersberg (The Man Who Fell to Earth, Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence) Hodges' first theatrical feature in almost a decade proved that he'd lost none of his edge.

When a shark escapes and attacks a pleasure boat, the company sponsoring the research threatens to pull its funding and sends corporate executive Russell Franklin (Samuel L. Jackson) to investigate. McAlester has just 48 hours to prove the value of her work, but her experiments have made the sharks smarter. No longer happy to be injected, prodded, and caged, they begin to turn the tables. As a freak storm causes chaos on the surface, making it impossible to leave, the facility is flooded and the scientists must fight to survive against the rising water and the hungry sharks that now swim freely through the corridors.Embracing action, horror and suspense with a knowing sense of humour and pushing them all as far as they can go, Deep Blue Sea is an adrenaline rush of pure entertainment presented in a brand new 4K restoration approved by director Renny Harlin.

    "description": "NO EVIL DEED GOES UNDONE.Like many of his contemporaries, Godfather of Gore Lucio Fulci (City of the Living Dead, Don't Torture a Duckling) found his career on a downturn at the end of the 1980s as the bottom fell out of the Italian horror movie market. While much of his latter-day output went straight to video, these low-budget productions nonetheless offer up some diamonds in the rough, among them his 1990 tale of rampaging Satanic Sisters - Demonia, regarded by many as his last great film.A Canadian archaeological team, led by Professor Evans (Brett Halsey, The Devil's Honey), descends on the ruins of a medieval Sicilian monastery to undertake an excavation. But when Evans' protégé, Liza (Meg Register, Ministry of Vengeance), goes searching for an explanation to the disturbing visions she's been experiencing, she awakens the spirit of three Satan-worshiping nuns put to death centuries earlier by a violent mob, unleashing an orgy of vengeful violence on the unsuspecting explorers.Originally destined for a theatrical release, Demonia is a return to the atmosphere and gory excesses of Fulci's late 70s/early 80s output - a no-holds-barred Satanic shocker co-starring Lino Salemme (Demons) and Al Cliver (Zombie Flesh Eaters) and co-written by Piero Regnoli (Burial Ground) - presented here in a pristine restoration and a host of extras.SPECIAL EDITION CONTENTS4K restoration from the original 35mm camera negativeHigh Definition Blu-ray (1080p) presentationRestored original lossless mono English and Italian soundtracksOptional English subtitles for the deaf and hard of hearing for the English soundtrackEnglish subtitles for the Italian soundtrackAudio commentary by Stephen Thrower, author of Beyond Terror: The Films of Lucio FulciHoly Demons, a video interview with uncredited co-writer/assistant director Antonio TentoriOf Skulls and Bones, a video interview with camera operator Sandro GrossiFulci Lives!!!, camcorder footage of a visit to the Demonia set, including an interview with Lucio FulciOriginal trailerReversible sleeve featuring two newly commissioned artwork options by Graham Humphreys",

Empire became a mainstay of video stores across the world with their catchy titles, outlandish art and Band’s wholehearted belief in giving audiences a good time.In The Dungeonmaster (AKA Ragewar), computer programmer Paul Bradford is sucked into a fantasy world by Mestema, a demonic sorcerer in search of a worthy opponent. Meanwhile, fresh from the one-two punch of Re-Animator and From Beyond, director Stuart Gordon takes a turn toward fairytale gothic in Dolls, in which a group of strangers find themselves forced to seek shelter at the isolated home of an old toymaker and his wife, only to find that the puppets and dolls have a vicious life of their own. In Cellar Dweller, a comic book artist (Jeffrey Combs) with a penchant for the macabre takes inspiration from an ancient tome and unleashes an ancient evil. Arena presents the ultimate fight night event: man vs monster! In the far future of 4038, a short order cook becomes the first human in fifty years to compete in an intergalactic boxing event on the far side of the universe. Finally in Robot Jox, Stuart Gordon directs Empire Pictures' most ambitious movie yet, as men and women pilot giant machines in gladiatorial battle to settle international disputes over territory.Freshly restored for the digital era with a wealth of new and archival extras, these films have never looked better.

Regan remembers nothing, but her therapist Dr Tuskin (Louise Fletcher) believes those memories are simply repressed and waiting. Meanwhile, Father Philip Lamont (Richard Burton) - his own faith shaken by a failed exorcism - is tasked by the Vatican with investigating Father Merrin, who faces posthumous charges of heresy for his controversial writings. His investigation will lead him to Africa, New York and Georgetown as he and Regan are drawn together in a spiritual battle that encircles the globe.With an all-star cast, sublime cinematography, and a standout score from legendary composer Ennio Morricone, Exorcist II: The Heretic is a daring vision, packed with the kind of bold ideas and extraordinary images that Boorman would also explore in Zardoz and Excalibur.

But all is not as it seems. Now someone is trying to kill Rollie, and grizzled cop Leo McCarthy (Brian Dennehy) suspects him of murder. Unable to turn to the police, Rollie goes on the run with only his wits and his special effects expertise to save him. F/X was a smash-hit and a sequel was inevitable. Under the auspices of ace Australian director Richard Franklin (Psycho II), F/X 2: The Deadly Art of Illusion sees Rollie convinced, against his better judgement, to once again use his expertise beyond the silver screen, this time helping to trap a murderer as part of an NYPD sting. When lightning strikes twice and things go wrong, Rollie, his girlfriend Kim (Rachel Ticotin) and her young son Chris are all plunged into danger; only with Leo's help can Rollie keep them safe.Beloved by a generation of movie fans and featuring two of the most charismatic character actors ever to grace the screen in Brown and Dennehy, F/X and F/X 2 are the kind of charming action-thrillers they just don't seem to be making anymore.

    "description": "Arrow VideoVengeful army vets, ruthless organised criminals, and desperate parent-child psychodramas await you in these four classics from noir streets less travelled.In Calcutta (1946), Neale (Alan Ladd, Shane), a cynical cargo pilot, investigates the murder of a close friend and finds himself falling into the arms of his late friend’s mysterious fiancée, Virginia (Gail Russell, The Uninvited). When he connects the murder to a ring of illicit jewellery-smugglers, he becomes their next target. Is Virginia as innocent and vulnerable as she seems? In Ride the Pink Horse (1947), Gagin (Robert Montgomery, Lady in the Lake), a surly former Gi, goes after the crime boss who murdered his friend. His gambit: to put the screws to the gangster with the same extortion plot that got Gagin’s buddy killed.This time things have to end differently, right? In Outside the Law (1956), Johnny Salvo, (Ray Danton, The Longest Day), a convict paroled into military service, is called back stateside on a mission that could clear his record: get inside the counterfeiting racket that killed his army buddy. Not only is the assignment dangerous, but Salvo’s got to work for the cop who put him behind bars - his own estranged father. Finally, in The Female Animal (1958), a glamorous movie star (Hedy Lamarr, Samson and Delilah) and her alcoholic daughter (Jane Powell, Seven Brides for Seven Brothers) vie for the affections of a handsome young movie extra (George Nader, Robot Monster) who has entered their lives. When the older woman generously opens her lifestyle to the young man, his insecurities feed his ambivalence. When he ends up in the arms of her daughter, disaster looms.This collection of noir’s neglected treasures doesn’t stick to the city streets: from smuggling contraband in the skies over Asia to drowning beneath the torrent of a Hollywood waterfall, the genre’s darkness lurks everywhere.Product FeaturesHigh Definition (1080p) Blu-ray presentations of four films: Calcutta, Ride the Pink Horse, Outside the Law and The Female AnimalOriginal lossless mono audio on all filmsOptional English subtitles for the deaf and hard of hearing on all filmsAudio commentaries by leading scholars and critics Nick Pinkerton (Calcutta), Josh Nelson (Ride the Pink Horse), Richard Harland Smith (Outside the Law) and David Del Valle (The Female Animal)Brand new visual essay on Calcutta by critic Jon TowlsonBrand new visual essays on Ride the Pink Horse and The Female Animal by author and critic Alexandra Heller-NicholasBrand new visual essay on Outside the Law by author and producer Kat EllingerVintage radio play version of Ride the Pink Horse, starring Robert Montgomery, Wanda Hendrix and Thomas GomezTheatrical trailersImage galleriesLimited edition packaging with reversible sleeves featuring original and newly commissioned artwork by Scott SaslowDouble-sided fold-out posters for each film featuring original and newly commissioned artwork by Scott SaslowLimited edition hardback collector’s book featuring new writing on the films by film critics Andrew Graves, Jon Towlson, Barry Forshaw and Nora MacIntyre",

    "description": "Arrow VideoIn the early 1970s, when the giallo boom was at its peak, producer-turned-director Luciano Ercoli helmed three standalone but thematically linked examples of the genre, each featuring a memorable star turn by Spanish born actress and model Nieves Navarro (billed under her adopted stage name of Susan Scott). Accompanied by a rogues' gallery of familiar and recurring faces, this trilogy of terror represents the giallo at its most playful and unpredictable.In The Forbidden Photos of a Lady Above Suspicion, Minou's (Dagmar Lassander, The Iguana with the Tongue of Fire) dull but pampered life is upturned by a mysterious sadist (Simón Andreu, Death Carries a Cane) who blackmails her into submitting to his every perverted whim. Desperate to escape his clutches, Minou confides in her libidinous best friend Dominique (Navarro)... but is she more involved than she's letting on? Then, in Death Walks on High Heels, Navarro stars as exotic dancer Nicole, daughter of a murdered jewel thief, who finds herself terrorized by a black-clad assailant determined to procure her father's stolen gems. Fleeing Paris and her knife-wielding pursuer, Nicole arrives in London, only to discover that death stalks her at every corner. Finally, in Death Walks at Midnight, Navarro stars as Valentina - a model who, in the midst of a drug-fueled photoshoot, witnesses a brutal murder in the apartment opposite hers. But when the authorities refuse to believe a crime has been committed, Valentina is forced to assume the role of amateur sleuth.With glamor, perversity and narrative twists and turns aplenty, each of these giallo delights is fully restored from original elements and presented alongside an array of all-encompassing bonus features.Product Features2K restorations from the original 35mm camera negatives for The Forbidden Photos of a Lady Above Suspicion and Death Walks on High Heels2K restoration from an original 35mm internegative for Death Walks at MidnightHigh Definition Blu-ray (1080p) presentations of each filmOriginal Italian and English front and end titlesOriginal lossless mono Italian and English soundtracksOptional English subtitles for the Italian soundtracksOptional English subtitles for the deaf and hard of hearing for the English soundtracksRigid box packaging with newly designed artwork by Gilles Vranckx in a windowed Giallo Essentials Collection slipcoverReversible sleeves for each film featuring original and newly commissioned artwork by The Twins of Evil and Gilles VranckxDisc One: The Forbidden Photos Of A Lady Above SuspicionAudio commentary by Kat Ellinger, author and editor-in-chief of Diabolique MagazinePrivate Pictures, a documentary featuring interviews with actress Nieves Navarro, director Luciano Ercoli and writer Ernesto GastaldiThe Forbidden Soundtrack of the Big Three, an appreciation of the music of Forbidden Photos and 70s Italian cult cinema by musician and soundtrack collector Lovely JonThe Forbidden Lady, a Q&A with actress Dagmar Lassander at the 2016 Festival of Fantastic FilmsOriginal Italian and English theatrical trailersImage galleryDisc Two: Death Walks On High HeelsAudio commentary by film critic Tim LucasIntroduction to the film by screenwriter Ernesto GastaldiFrom Spain with Love, featurette with director Luciano Ercoli and actress Nieves Navarro, interviewed at their home in BarcelonaMaster of Giallo, screenwriter Ernesto Gastaldi on Death Walks on High Heels and how to write a successful gialloDeath Walks to the Beat, a career-spanning interview with High Heels composer Stelvio CiprianiOriginal Italian and English trailersDisc Three: Death Walks At MidnightAudio commentary by film critic Tim LucasIntroduction to the film by screenwriter Ernesto GastaldiExtended TV version of the featureCrime Does Pay, screenwriter Gastaldi reflects on his career in the crime film-writing business, including a look at Death Walks at MidnightDesperately Seeking Susan, visual essay by Michael Mackenzie exploring the distinctive giallo collaborations between director Luciano Ercoli and star Nieves Navarro",

    "title": "Gothic Fantastico - Four Italian Tales Of Terror",
    "price": "£50.00",
    "description": "Arrow VideoWhile groundbreaking director Mario Bava (Black Sunday, Black Sabbath) remains the most well-known purveyor of Italian Gothic horror, many other filmmakers tried their hand at the form throughout the 1960s as part of a hugely prolific and popular cycle. Gothic Fantastico presents four off-the-beaten path titles from this classic period, all of which demonstrate Italy’s ability to expand genre beyond the classic literary monsters that dominated elsewhere.Gaslighting abounds in Massimo Pupillo’s Lady Morgan’s Vengeance - a delicate tale of romance and mystery, with a sprinkling of sadism and the supernatural - as newlywed Sir Harold Morgan (Paul Muller, Nightmare Castle) attempts to destroy his new bride (Barbara Nelli, Double Face) with help from his sinister maid (Erika Blanc, Kill, Baby… Kill!). Meanwhile, the perverse influence of Poe is used to great effect in Alberto De Martino’s The Blancheville Monster - a tale of family curses and madmen in the attic, as Emilie de Blancheville (Ombretta Colli, Gladiator of Rome) returns home to her brother Rodéric (Gérard Tichy, Hatchet for the Honeymoon) and discovers her own family may be out for her blood. Mino Guerrini’s The Third Eye features not only a very early role for Italian cult film icon Franco Nero, but a plot that borrows several elements from Hitchcock, layered with a whiff of necrophilia. Finally, Damiano Damiani’s The Witch takes a more avant-garde approach, when a young historian (Richard Johnson, Zombie Flesh Eaters) is lured to work for an ageing woman, only to be held captive when he becomes obsessed with her beautiful daughter (Rosanna Schiaffino, The Killer Reserved Nine Seats).Madness, obsession and messed up families are the order of the day in these four lesser-known monochrome gems from Italy’s peak Gothic period, fully restored in 2K from their original negatives and presented alongside an array of in-depth extras.Product Features2K restorations from the original camera negatives of all four filmsHigh Definition Blu-ray (1080p) presentations of each filmOriginal Italian and English front and end titles on The Blancheville Monster, The Third Eye and The WitchOriginal lossless mono Italian soundtracks on all four filmsOriginal lossless mono English soundtracks on The Blancheville Monster, The Third Eye and The WitchOptional English subtitles for the Italian soundtracksOptional English subtitles for the deaf and hard of hearing for the English soundtracksVideo introductions to each film by Italian film devotee Mark Thompson AshworthImage galleriesReversible sleeves featuring original and newly commissioned artwork by Colin MurdochDisc One: Lady Morgan's VengeanceAudio commentary by author and critic Alexandra Heller-NicholasVideo essay on the film by author and producer Kat EllingerVideo interview with actress Erika BlancVideo interview with actor Paul MullerAudio interview with director Massimo PupilloThe complete original cineromanzo, published in Suspense in April 1971TrailerDisc Two: The Blancheville MonsterAudio commentary by filmmaker and film historian Paul Anthony NelsonVideo essay on the film by writer and pop culture historian Keith AllisonVideo interview with author and filmmaker Antonio TentoriOpening credits for the Us release of the filmTrailerDisc Three: The Third EyeAudio commentary by author and critic Rachael NisbetVideo essay on the film by author and filmmaker Lindsay HallamVideo interview with actress Erika BlancDisc Four: The WitchAudio commentary by author and producer Kat EllingerVideo essay on the film by author and academic Miranda CorcoranVideo interview with author and filmmaker Antonio Tentori",

By the time it premiered in 1966, two of its stars had tragically taken their own lives; the eccentric director's insistence on filming in the obscure Esperanto language ensured it failed to receive any distribution; and it was nearly lost forever when the original elements were believed lost in a fire. Decades passed until it was finally saved and unveiled to the public in all its unholy glory!Wounded in battle, soldier Marc (William Shatner, just prior to being cast in Star Trek) ventures to the remote village of Nomen Tuum to find a well where the waters are said to be blessed with healing powers. Little does he suspect that the inhabitants of Nomen Tuum are demonic seductresses who entice interlopers and lead them to damnation, and one such succubus, Kia (Allyson Ames) has her sights on Marc. As an eclipse shrouds the sun and darkness falls over the village, Marc and Kia's relationship becomes more passionate... will his soul survive?Now restored in 4K from the last known surviving 35mm print, this eerie and unforgettable American folk horror from the creator of The Outer Limits survives to chill a new generation as never seen before.

    "price": "£45.00",
    "description": "Arrow VideoVengeful ghosts returning from beyond the grave, young women with supernatural abilities, investigative narratives, a terror of technology, and an ominous aura of urban alienation and isolation mark the wave of horror and mystery films that emerged in Japan at the turn of the millennium, collectively labeled as \"J-Horror\". Remastered from the best available elements and packed with a host of new and archival extras, J-Horror Rising presents seven of the genre's most distinctive titles.In the ghostly pastoral horror of Shikoku, a young woman returns after many years to her rural birthplace, only to find her best friend from childhood has died by drowning when just sixteen. The dead girl's mother, the local Shintoist priestess, has embarked on the region's famous pilgrimage - but why is she walking backwards? The aftermath of the devasting Kobe Earthquake of 1995 creates fissures in the already fractured mind of a high-school girl in Isola: Multiple Personality Girl, allowing an unwelcome intruder to set up home in her head and leaving a volunteer worker with psychic powers to determine which of her personas is the fake one. Shikoku also provides the mystical backdrop to Inugami, as a teacher from Tokyo finds himself drawn to a local papermaker, only to find himself the subject of some hostility from her extended family, who have long ties to the region and are rumored to be the descendants of the guardians of ancient evil canine spirits.Megumi Okina (Ju-On: The Grudge) plays the art designer for a horror-themed videogame in the innovative St. John's Wort, who is forced to confront her childhood traumas when her colleagues ask her to gather visual materials from the creepy gothic mansion she has inherited from her estranged artist father. Carved: The Slit-Mouthed Woman features the titular predatory murderess drawn from urban legend, where it turns out home isn't the safest place for her potential child victims in this disturbing supernatural horror. A new craze for wearing ceramic masks sweeps the students of a high school, unleashing a wave of anonymous juvenile delinquency amongst the literal fashion-victims of Persona, which boasts early appearances from Battle Royale stars Tatsuya Fujiwara and Chiaki Kuriyama. Last but not least, the chilling Noroi: The Curse adopts a pseudo-documentary format as an investigative reporter into paranormal phenomena is forced to confront horrors beyond his wildest imagination after learning about an ancient folkloric demon.Product FeaturesLIMITED EDITION CONTENTSHigh Definition (1080p) Blu-ray presentations of all seven filmsOriginal lossless 5.1 and lossless stereo sound options for Shikoku, Isola: Multiple Personality Girl, Inugami, St. John's Wort, Carved: The Slit-Mouthed Woman and Noroi: The Curse, and original lossless stereo audio for PersonaOptional English subtitles for each filmIllustrated collector's booklet featuring new writing by Eugene Thacker, Jasper Sharp, Anton Bitel, Amber T., Mark Player, Jim Harper and Sarah AppletonDouble-sided foldout poster featuring newly commissioned artwork by John ConlonLimited Edition packaging featuring newly commissioned artwork by John ConlonDISC ONE: SHIKOKU / ISOLA: MULTIPLE PERSONALITY GIRLBrand new audio commentary on Shikoku by Japanese cinema expert Tom MesBrand new audio commentary on Isola: Multiple Personality Girl by critics and Japanese cinema experts Jasper Sharp and Amber T.The Aftermath, Tom Mes discusses J-Horror at the turn of the millenniumSomething in the Water, a brand new interview with Shikoku director Shunichi NagasakiArchive interviews with director Shunichi Nagasaki and actors Chiaki Kuriyama and Yui Natsukawa on ShikokuArchive interview with actors Yoshino Kimura and Yu Kurosawa on Isola: Multiple Personality GirlOn-set footage of the filming of ShikokuOriginal trailers and TV spots for both filmsImage galleriesDISC TWO: INUGAMI / ST.

His plans for uninterrupted solitude are scuppered however, when he encounters Nicky (Hayden J Weal) and other hikers, only exacerbating his paranoia. As Ian's grip on reality weakens, he becomes convinced they are being followed. Miles from civilisation, their journey turns into a fight for survival as Ian's fears manifest into a surreal battle against an unseen threat lurking in the wilderness. Is it all just in his head?

    "price": "£35.00",
    "description": "Arrow VideoOutrageous, absurdist, grotesque! Often hilarious, always stylish, and utterly unpredictable, the films of Spanish director Álex de la Iglesia are an exhilarating shock to the cinematic system.Produced by legendary provocateur Pedro Almodóvar, de la Iglesia's debut feature Acción Mutante is a violent sci-fi black comedy set in a post-apocalyptic world where attractive people hold all the power and a terrorist group, who see themselves as mutants, take arms to rid the world of their superficial oppressors. With his second feature, The Day of the Beast (El día de la bestia) de la Iglesia delivered one of the greatest horror comedies of all time as a Catholic priest joins forces with a heavy metal fan, and the host of a popular occult TV show to kill the Antichrist on Christmas Eve. A critical and commercial success around the world, The Day of the Beast paved the way for gonzo action-crime-horror Perdita Durango, (aka Dance with the Devil) a Spanish-US-Mexican co-production based on a novel by Barry Gifford (author of Wild at Heart). Starring Rosie Perez (Do the Right Thing), a then little known Javier Bardem (No Country for Old Men) and James Gandolfini (The Sopranos), Perdita Durango is a twisted tale of love, guns, drugs, voodoo ceremonies, and refrigerated foetuses...Packed with a wealth of new and archival extras, Arrow Video welcomes you to the delirious, diabolical and demented world of Álex de la Iglesia.

    "price": "£60.00",
    "description": "Arrow VideoShocking and controversial, yet permeated with a dark, poetic beauty, the films of underground German auteur Jörg Buttgereit stand at the very intersection between art and exploitation.In Nekromantik, the director's groundbreaking 1987 debut, nihilistic couple Rob and Betty seek to enliven their relationship by bringing a freshly-acquired corpse into the equation, with predictably nauseating results. 1990's Der Todesking takes a more experimental - but no less gruelling - approach, offering up seven vignettes of suicide, one for each day of the week, all prompted by a mysterious chain letter. In 1991, Buttgereit would return to the realm of corpse-loving with Nekromantik 2, which sees the young Monika torn between the two men in her life - the dorky yet doting Mark, and a rapidly-decomposing cadaver. Lastly, with 1993's Schramm, Buttgereit takes us deep into the deranged mind of a psychopath, charting the final days in the life of twisted sex killer Lothar Schramm.With Memento Mori: The Jörg Buttgereit Collection - which brings together all four of the director's feature films, packed with extras and accompanied by a wealth of exclusive content - Arrow Video is proud to offer up the definitive compendium of this most singular of genre filmmakers.Product Features5-DISC LIMITED EDITION CONTENTSHigh Definition Blu-ray (1080p) presentation of all filmsUncompressed PCM stereo 2.0 audio for all films and additional mono audio option for NekromantikOptional English subtitles for all filmsLimited edition packaging incorporating an exclusive, 100-page rigid book featuring new writing by David Kerekes, author of Sex Murder Art: The Films of Jörg Buttgereit, a selection of archival essays and the colour debut of the Nekromantik comic book sequel, Son of NekromantikExclusive bonus disc containing the extended cut of Nekromantik 2, the home video premiere of the 2020 Jörg Buttgereit-directed documentary short Schweinchen, recently-unearthed short films and more!Original Nekromantik 2 16mm film stripDISC ONE: NEKROMANTIKAudio commentary with Jörg Buttgereit and co-writer Franz Rodenkirchen2014 introduction by Jörg ButtgereitAlternative \"Grindhouse\" version of NekromantikIn Conversation with The Death King -

But when Hans encounters the professor's beautiful and mysterious daughter Elfi (Scilla Gabel, Modesty Blaise), his own fate becomes inexorably bound up with hers, and with the shocking secret that lies at the heart of the so-called Mill of the Stone Women.The first Italian horror film to be shot in colour, Mill of the Stone Women prefigured a raft of other spaghetti nightmares, including the work of maestros Mario Bava and Dario Argento.

Klára is charming, trusting and beautiful, whilst Viktoria is wicked, sadistic, bursting with hate and jealousy - and who hatches a terrible revenge by slowly poisoning her more popular sister.

Tomi works at a local hostess bar and hopes for a better fate for Yumi. When Ryoichi violently forces himself upon her blossoming daughter, Tomi is not afraid to take action to protect her, an act which lands her in jail.

Rainer Werner Fassbinder Vol. 2 brings together a collection of his key works from the mid-section of his career in high definition digital restorations prepared by the Rainer Werner Fassbinder Foundation.Among Fassbinder's best-loved works, Fear Eats the Soul sees the director paying homage to the classic melodramas of Douglas Sirk in its poignant portrayal of a relationship between a widowed cleaning lady in her sixties and a Moroccan immigrant in his thirties that causes an outrage with her family, friends and neighbours. Fassbinder's long-gestating adaptation of Theodor Fontane's classic German novel Effi Briest, his most expensive production to date as well as one of his most ambitious, tells the tale of a seventeen year-old girl who is married off by her parents to a wealthy Baron more than twice her age.Fassbinder himself plays the protagonist of Fox and His Friends, a sweet working class soul whose relationship with wealthy industrialist Eugen, he discovers, is based almost wholly on his unexpected lottery win. Chinese Roulette is a tense psychodrama set in an isolated house during a weekend break in which infidelities are revealed and families break down. Fassbinder's international breakthrough film, The Marriage of Maria Braun charts the rise to prosperity of its tenacious and pragmatic central character across the post-war years as she holds out hope for the return of the young soldier she was married to for less than 24-hours before he was dispatched to the Russian front and later reported dead.Product FeaturesHigh definition digital transfers of all films prepared by the Rainer Werner Fassbinder FoundationHigh Definition (1080p) Blu-ray presentations of all filmsOriginal uncompressed PCM mono 1.0 sound for all filmsOptional English subtitles for all filmsReversible sleeves featuring original and newly commissioned artwork by Sister Hyde.Disc One - Fear Eats The SoulAudio commentary by critic and lecturer Mark FreemanMy Name is Not Ali, Viola Shafik's 2011 feature-length documentary on the life and death of El Hedi ben Salem, star of Fear Eats the SoulInterview with director of photography Jürgen JürgesTheatrical trailerDisc Two - Effi BriestAudio commentary by Ken MouldenInterview with actor Ulli LommelInterview with director of photography Jürgen JürgesTheatrical trailerDisc Three - Fox And His Friends & Chinese RouletteAudio commentary by Hamish Ford on Fox and His FriendsInterview with actor Ulli Lommel on Chinese RouletteOriginal theatrical trailers for both filmsDisc Four - The Marriage Of Maria BraunLife, Love & Celluloid, a 1998 feature-length documentary on Fassbinder, written and directed by his regular editor, Juliane LorenzRainer Werner Fassbinder, 1977, a candid 30-minute interview with the directorThe Fassbinder Family, featurette detailing the actors who worked with Fassbinder time and again throughout his career",

    "description": "Four filmmakers from completely different backgrounds bring their radically personal takes to the stories of Japan’s celebrated master of the macabre, Edogawa Rampo (Horrors of Malformed Men, Blind Beast).In “Mars’s Canal”, by music video director and visual artist Suguru Takeuchi, a lone man encounters the other side of his psyche beyond the reflective surface of a circular pond set in a desolate landscape. Japanese New Wave auteur and longtime director of the Ultraman series Akio Jissoji (This Transient Life, Mandala) harnesses his distinctive stylistic sheen in his story of a mad mirror maker, “Mirror Hell”. “Caterpillar” sees the singular vision of cult director Hisayasu Sato (The Bedroom, Naked Blood) at its most grotesque, in his portrait of a wounded war veteran who returns from the frontline as little more than a bloody torso, helpless to defend himself against the increasingly perverted caprices of an embittered wife. Finally, a famous actor is subjected to the obsessive attentions of her limo driver in “Crawling Bugs”, the directorial debut of internationally acclaimed manga artist Atsushi Kaneko (Bambi and Her Pink Gun).Produced by the same team behind Ichi the Killer and Uzumaki, and with a cast featuring some of Japan’s top stars, including Tadanobu Asano (Maboroshi, Silence) and Ryuhei Matsuda (Blue Spring, Gohatto), Rampo Noir is a stylistic tour-de-force that vividly evokes the “erotic grotesque” worlds created by Japan’s pioneering proponent of horror and mystery fiction.LIMITED EDITION CONTENTSHigh Definition Blu-ray™ (1080p) presentationOriginal lossless Japanese stereo audioOptional newly translated English subtitlesBrand new audio commentary by Japanese film experts Jasper Sharp and Alexander ZahltenAnother World, a new interview with Suguru Takeuchi, director of “Mars’s Canal”A Moving Transformation, a new interview with Hisayasu Sato, director of “Caterpillar”Butterfly Queen, a new interview with Atsushi Kaneko, manga artist and director of “Crawling Bugs”Hall of Mirrors, a new interview with cinematographer Masao Nakabori about working with Akio Jissoji and “Mirror Hell”The Butterfly Effect, a new interview with Akiko Ashizawa, the cinematographer of “Caterpillar”Looking in the Mirror, a new interview with actor Yumi Yoshiyuki about “Mirror Hell”Archive stage greeting footage with the cast and directors from the Japanese premiere of Rampo NoirCrossing the Lens, a feature-length making-of documentary by Tatsuya Fukushima from 2006Image galleryReversible sleeve featuring original and newly commissioned artwork by Luke InsectIllustrated collector’s booklet featuring new writing on the film by Eugene Thacker and Seth Jacobowitz",

    "price": "£120.00",
    "description": "Arrow VideoBefore Hong Kong's mightiest film studio mastered the art of the kung fu film, Shaw Brothers hit box office gold with a very different kind of martial arts cinema, one that channelled the blood-soaked widescreen violence of Japanese samurai epics and Italian spaghetti westerns into a uniquely Chinese form: the wuxia pian. With their enthralling tales drawn from historical myth and legend of sword-wielding (and often gravity-defying) noble heroes, the wuxia films housed in this next instalment of Arrow Video's best-selling Shawscope series demonstrate the sweeping stylistic evolution of the genre, from the righteous stoicism of the late-60s Mandarin period, right through to the wild-and-weird anarchism of the early-80s Cantonese explosion.The iconic One-Armed Swordsman trilogy, directed between 1967 and 1971 by wuxia cinema godfather Chang Cheh, made household names of stars Wang Yu and David Chiang and set the gory template for many of the films to come. Contrary to Chang's tales of loyal brotherhood, many wuxia films focused on female protagonists, three very different examples of which we see next: Ho Meng-hua's The Lady Hermit, with the great Cheng Pei-pei (Come Drink with Me) as a virtuous swordswoman called upon to stop a vicious warlord; Chor Yuen's scandalous Intimate Confessions of a Chinese Courtesan in which the titular lady of the night masters every deadly skill she can to get revenge on those who enslaved her; and Cheng Kang's all-star epic The 14 Amazons, in which Shaws' finest starlets play the real-life women of the Yang dynasty, avenging their fallen menfolk in battle.Next, Chor Yuen adapted several beloved novels by consummate wuxia storyteller Gu Long to the big screen, four of which are collected here: The Magic Blade, Clans of Intrigue, Jade Tiger and The Sentimental Swordsman, all starring the redoubtable Ti Lung. As kung fu overtook wuxia at the box office, the genre evolved into unexpected new directions, with its chivalrous knights-errant replaced by conflicted antiheroes, as seen in Sun Chung’s breathlessly exciting The Avenging Eagle and Boxer's Omen goremeister Kuei Chih-hung's fatalistic masterpiece Killer Constable. Finally, just when it seemed the wuxia film had nowhere left to turn, Eighties excess reigned supreme in the special-effects-soaked, fourth-wall-breaking fantastical delights of Taylor Wong's Buddha's Palm and Lu Chun-ku's Bastard Swordsman.Back with all-new exclusive restorations and hours of insightful bonus material, if you thought the previous two Shawscope sets showed the Shaw Brothers at its strongest, you ain't seen nothing yet!Product FeaturesLIMITED EDITION BLU-RAY COLLECTION CONTENTSHigh Definition (1080p) presentations of all fourteen films, including thirteen new 2K restorations by Arrow FilmsIllustrated 60-page collectors' booklet featuring new writing by David West, Jonathan Clements and Dylan Cheung, plus cast and crew listings and notes on each film by Ian JaneNew artwork by Chris Malbon, \"Kung Fu Bob\" O'Brien, Tom Ralston, Ilan Sheady, Tony Stella and Jolyon YatesHours of illuminating bonus features, including feature commentaries and several cast-and-crew interviews from the Frédéric Ambroisine Video ArchiveExclusive CD of music from the De Wolfe Music Library as heard in several Shaw Brothers classicsDISC ONE -

    "title": "Tales From the Urban Jungle",
    "price": "£18.00",
    "description": "Arrow VideoWriter, director, producer and actor Jules Dassin was one of Hollywood's most remarkable talents. Between 1947 and 1955 he directed a string of stylish, gritty, and hard-hitting Film Noir classics including Thieves' Highway and Night And The City. Blacklisted in the communist witch hunts of the House Un-American Activities, he would continue that run with Rififi, directed in France. Each film is a diamond hard classic, weathering the test of time with sharp edges intact.Tales from The Urban Jungle brings together the two films which started that extraordinary streak of hits. In Brute Force, Burt Lancaster is Joe Collins, one of a number of convicts squeezed into cell R17 and intent on breaking out. Desperate to return to his cancer ridden wife (Ann Blyth), and to escape the clutches of sadistic warden Captain Munsey (an unforgettable performance from Hume Cronyn) who enjoys a reign of terror over the inmates.Meanwhile, in The Naked City, a blonde ex-model is murdered in her bathtub and detectives Muldoon (Barry Fitzgerald) and Halloran (Don Taylor) are assigned to the case. Their investigation leads them all over New York City, from Park Avenue to the Lower East Side, reaching its thrilling climax atop the Williamsburg Bridge. Inspired by the work of infamous tabloid photographer Weegee, The Naked City was the first major Hollywood production to be shot entirely on the streets of New York, making use of more than a hundred authentic locations. Both films feature stark cinematography and taut writing to land an incredible one-two punch that remains impactful to this day.Sourced from 4K restorations and complemented by a wealth of bonus features, this special edition boxset is both the perfect entry point for newcomers to the work of a great director, and a must have for die-hard fans of Film Noir and Jules Dassin.High Definition Blu-ray (1080p) presentation of 4K restorations of both filmsOriginal uncompressed mono 1.0 audioOptional English subtitles for the deaf and hard of hearing for both filmsReversible sleeves featuring original and newly commissioned artwork by Sister HydeProduct FeaturesDisc One - Brute ForceCommentary by historian and critic Josh NelsonNothing's Okay, a visual essay by film historians David Cairns & Fiona WatsonJosh Olson: Brute Force, a personal appreciation by the Academy Award winning screenwriter of A History of ViolenceBurt Lancaster: The Film Noir Years, an in-depth look at Burt Lancaster's early career by Kate Buford, author of Burt Lancaster: An American LifeTheatrical trailersImage galleryDisc Two - The Naked CityNaked City Radio, commentary by historian and critic David Cairns featuring actors Steven McNicoll and Francesca DymondThe Pulse of the City, a visual essay by historian and critic Eloise RossNew York and The Naked City, a personalised history of NYC on the big screen by critic Amy TaubinJules Dassin at LACMA, a 52-minute interview with Bruce Goldstein in which the director discusses his careerThe Hollywood Ten, a 1950 documentary short on the ten filmmakers blacklisted from Hollywood for their refusal to name names before the House Un-American Activities Committee, including The Naked City's screenwriter Albert MaltzGallery of production stills by photojournalist WeegeeTheatrical trailer",

    "description": "Made after years of directing television and industrial films - and just one year before his commercial breakthrough with M*A*S*H - Robert Altman's underrated psychosexual chiller That Cold Day in the Park, arguably the first true 'Altman film', is a stylish harbinger of the themes that would resonate through many of the director's later masterpieces such as Images and 3 Women.On a cold and rainy day, Frances Austen (Sandy Dennis, Academy Award winner for Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?), a reclusive virgin sheltered from the sexual revolution happening outside her door, suddenly becomes obsessed with an enigmatic 19 year-old boy she sees sitting on a park bench. Inviting him into her apartment to be bathed and fed, Frances' repressed fantasies soon violently boil over into a dangerous and disturbing desire to keep the boy in her clutches... no matter what.Adapted from Richard Miles' novel by British author Gillian Freeman (The Leather Boys), Altman expertly turns the screws in this suspenseful tale of sexual repression, the chilly Vancouver locations vividly photographed by László Kovács the same year he lensed Easy Rider, and accompanied by a haunting score from Johnny Mandel, just before he co-wrote the anthem \"Suicide Is Painless\" for Altman's next film.SPECIAL EDITION CONTENTSHigh Definition (1080p) Blu-ray presentationOriginal lossless mono audioOptional English subtitles for the deaf and hard-of-hearingAudio commentary by critic Samm DeighanIsolated music and effects track in lossless monoCrazy in the Rain: Altman's Vancouver, a featurette revisiting the locations by Kier-La Janisse, author of House of Psychotic WomenArchive interview with film critic and historian David Thompson, author of Altman on AltmanExtended scenes from a pre-release print of the filmOver ten minutes of behind-thescenes footage featuring Altman and Dennis, from the archives of the Canadian Broadcasting CorporationTheatrical trailerImage galleryReversible sleeve featuring original and newly commissioned artwork by Tom Ralston",

When she is introduced to her son’s affable school principal (Greg Kinnear) and his socialite fiancée (Katie Holmes), Annie has a grisly premonition of things yet to come. After her violent vision comes true, all eyes turn to Annie, leaving her with no choice but to use her clairvoyant abilities to find the culprit herself. Could it be the abusive husband (Keanu Reeves) of one of Annie’s regular clients (Hilary Swank)? Or the nervy mechanic (Giovanni Ribisi) whose yearning for friendship masks an uncontrollable rage? Or is another terrible secret hiding in plain sight?Made right before a certain web-slinger finally catapulted Raimi from the cult fringes onto Hollywood’s A-list, The Gift is an underappreciated but vital entry in his filmography that is ripe for reappraisal with this brand new 4K remaster.LIMITED EDITION BLU-RAY CONTENTSNew 4K remaster from the 35mm interpositive by Arrow Films and Shout!

    "description": "Arrow VideoWith the two preceding films in his \"Dollars\" trilogy having unleashed a boom in Euro Western productions, Sergio Leone knew that his concluding chapter would have to top them all. Armed with his largest budget yet, Leone created what is, for many, the final word on the subject - a violent, picaresque epic presented with operatic scope and intensity, with Clint Eastwood donning the iconic hat and poncho one last time.A partnership between two scoundrels, Blondie (Eastwood) and Tuco (Eli Wallach) goes awry, only for fate to intervene in the form of information about a cache of stolen Confederate gold buried in a graveyard. Each possessing a different clue to its location, the pair are forced into a distrustful partnership. However, the gold is also sought by Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef), a ruthless mercenary with his own twisted code of honour. Thus begins a desperate pursuit amidst the mass destruction and absurdity of the American Civil War, culminating in an iconic three-way standoff inside the graveyard.Mythic, cynical and endlessly entertaining, The Good, The Bad and The Ugly brings Leone's grand sense of dramatic scale to its apotheosis. Arrow Films is proud to present this landmark Western in the most comprehensive edition ever assembled, featuring multiple cuts of the film, all meticulously restored in glorious 4K, and a wealth of new and archival bonus materials.Product FeaturesFULL SPECS ANNOUNCED IN MARCH!",

In 1987 his acclaimed epic The Last Emperor – made with British producer Jeremy Thomas (Naked Lunch, Crash) – swept the 60th Academy Awards winning nine Oscars including Best Picture and Best Director.Following the life of Pu Yi, the last of the Emperors of China, from his birth in 1906 through his childhood in the fortress-like Forbidden City and his later misguided collaboration with the Japanese in World War II, The Last Emperor tells the history of China through the eyes of the man brought up to believe he was the country’s divine ruler.Filmed on location in China, Bertolucci and Thomas were the first western filmmakers to be allowed access to previously forbidden locations. Together with a cast including John Lone, Joan Chen, and Peter O’Toole, and director of photography Vittorio Storaro’s lushly evocative cinematography, they created a classic film of sweeping scope and delicate intimacy that stunned critics and audiences alike. The Last Emperor arrives on Blu-ray in a 4K restoration that will take your breath away.Product FeaturesNew 4K restoration of the original theatrical versionHigh Definition (1080p) Blu-ray presentationOriginal uncompressed stereo 2.0 and 5.1 audio optionsOptional English subtitlesFirst to Last: The Road to the Forbidden City, a new visual essay by film critic David Cairns exploring Bernardo Bertolucci’s career prior to The Last EmperorOpen the Door, a new visual essay by film critics David Cairns & Fiona Watson in which they follow Bertolucci into the Forbidden City to explore in-depth The Last Emperor and the truth on which it is basedArchive interviews with director Bernardo Bertolucci and stars John Lone and Joan ChenPostcardf rom China, video footage shot by Bernardo Bertolucci while location scouting in ChinaTheatrical trailerImage galleryReversible sleeve featuring two artwork options",

The two girls wind up in the company of escaped convict Krug (Garret Dillahunt) and his makeshift family of vile career criminals, who kidnap and brutally assault them before leaving them for dead. Fleeing from the scene of their violent crime during a storm, the thugs inadvertently seek refuge with Mari’s parents, anxious as to why their daughter hasn’t come home yet and primed to unleash the full forces of hell on anyone who would dare to touch so much as a hair on her head.Energetically directed by Dennis Iliadis from a new script by Carl Ellsworth (Red Eye, Disturbia), this remake of horror cinema’s seminal tale of bloody revenge has been described by Stephen King as “the best horror movie of the new century”.Product FeaturesTwo version of the film: the original Theatrical Version and the Unrated VersionOriginal uncompressed stereo audio and Dts-HD Ma 5.1 surround audio for both filmsOptional English subtitles for the deaf and hard of hearing on both filmsIllustrated collector’s booklet featuring new writing on the film by Zoë Rose SmithReversible sleeve featuring original and newly commissioned artwork by Eric Adrian LeeDisc One - Theatrical VersionHigh Definition Blu-ray (1080p) presentation of the original Theatrical Version of the filmExclusive new filmed introduction by director Dennis IliadisBrand new audio commentary by David Flint and Adrian SmithA River of Blood, a new 31-minute interview with Sara PaxtonThe Notorious Krug, a new 27-minute interview with actor Garret DillahuntSuspending Disbelief, a new 18-minute interview with screenwriter Carl EllsworthReviving the Legend, a new 33-minute interview with producer Jonathan CravenLook Inside Featurette, from the films original 2009 releaseDeleted scenesTheatrical trailerImage galleryDisc Two - Unrated VersionHigh Definition Blu-ray (1080p) presentation of the Unrated Version",

The wacky Sky High sees three American jocks on holiday in Greece being handed a tape by a mysterious figure, who begs them to not let it fall into the wrong hands before being shot by an unseen assassin. Featuring an early score from the great Hans Zimmer, Terminal Exposure focuses on two carefree beach photographers, who accidentally photograph a murder and immediately set after the assassin: a tall, gorgeous blonde with a rose tattoo on her behind. Glitch! sees two bumbling burglars whose attempt to throw the house party of the century in the luxury home of a Hollywood producer is foiled by a group of mobsters determined to collect what the producer owes them - no matter what. Take a martial arts school, throw in a snotty rich kid, a clumsy geek, a paranoid survivalist, two beach joggers, a cool secret agent and a mime, and you get Ninja Academy, a madcap karate comedy like no other starring Gerald Okamura (Big Trouble in Little China).

    "description": "Arrow VideoWE ALL GO A LITTLE MAD SOMETIMES... Shattering expectations and shocking audiences around the world, Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho changed the face of cinema in 1960. It remains one of the most iconic and influential movies ever made.Twenty three years later, Australian filmmaker Richard Franklin (Patrick, Road Games) boldly followed in the master's footsteps and directed Psycho II, a sequel that not only delivered on the promise of his earlier films, but also lived up to Hitchcock's original. Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) is declared sane and released from the facility in which he was being held, despite the complaints of Lila Loomis (née Crane, Vera Miles) sister of Norman's most famous victim. All Norman wants to do is live quietly and productively as a normal member of society. But is returning to the house he once shared with his mother, and running the motel that was the site of so many murders, really a good idea? Is he cured, or will he kill again?Psycho III would see Anthony Perkins himself take the franchise's reins for his directorial debut, bringing a stylish flair that suggested his time working with not only Alfred Hitchcock, but Orson Welles and Ken Russell had been well spent. A fallen nun (Diana Scarwid as Maureen Coyle), a sleazy drifter (Jeff Fahey as Duane Duke), and a curious reporter looking for a scoop (Roberta Maxwell as Tracy Venables) all arrive at the Bates Motel and 'Mother' is less than happy, especially when Norman begins to fall in love. Meanwhile, Psycho IV: The Beginning, written by Joseph Stefano (screenwriter of the 1960 original) and directed by master of horror Mick Garris, returns to the primal scene to show us how it all began in Anthony Perkins' final franchise appearance. Rehabilitated and happily married, Norman Bates has finally escaped from the overbearing influence of his abusive mother. But his wife is pregnant, and Norman finds himself afraid that the child will inherit his mental illness. When he hears talk radio host Fran Ambrose (CCH Pounder) discussing the topic of matricide, Norman calls in under a false name, to tell his story. Starring Henry Thomas (E.T.) as young Norman and Olivia Hussey (Black Christmas) as his mother, Norma.Featuring all new restorations of Psycho II, III and IV from the original camera negatives, Arrow Video invites you back inside the Bates Motel and wishes you a very pleasant stay.Product FeaturesLIMITED EDITION CONTENTSHigh Definition Blu-ray (1080p) presentations of all four filmsNew 4K restorations of Psycho II, Psycho III and Psycho IV from the original camera negativesDTS:X and mono audio options for Psycho, lossless stereo and 5.1 options for Psycho II and Psycho III, and lossless stereo audio for Psycho IVOptional English subtitles for the deaf and hard of hearingReversible sleeves featuring original and newly commissioned artwork by Matt GriffinDouble-sided posters for each film featuring original and newly commissioned artwork by Matt Griffin -9 postcard sized reproduction art cards120-page perfect bound collector's book featuring new writing by film critics John-Paul Checkett and Johnny Mains plus select archival material.Disc 1 - PSYCHO60th Anniversary edition from Universal Pictures with uncut and re-release versions of the filmAudio commentary with Stephen Rebello, author of Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of PsychoThe Making of Psycho documentary - In the Master's Shadow: Hitchcock's Legacy featuretteHitchcock / Truffaut audio interview with scenes from the movieNewsreel Footage: The Release of Psycho featuretteThe Shower Scene: With & Without Music featuretteThe Shower Sequence, storyboards by Saul Bass image galleryPsycho Sound featuretteThe Psycho Archives image galleryPosters and Psycho Ads image galleryLobby Cards image galleryBehind the Scenes Photographs image galleryPublicity Shots image galleryTheatrical trailerRe-release trailersDisc 2 - PSYCHO IINew audio commentary by film critics Michael Brooke and Johnny MainsArchival audio commentary by screenwriter Tom HollandBehind the Curtain: The Masters of Horror on Psycho, panel discussion with screenwriter Tom Holland and Psycho IV director Mick Garris moderated by Robert V.

Rainer Werner Fassbinder vol. 3 brings together a collection of his lesser seen works from various stages in his career, featuring high definition digital restorations prepared by the Rainer Werner Fassbinder Foundation.Gods of the Plague portrays a newly released ex-con as he reacquaints himself with Munich’s criminal underworld to plan the robbery of a supermarket. In Rio Das Mortes, two feckless young friends, Michel and Günther, embark on a hare-brained scheme to look for lost treasure in Peru, against strong opposition from Michel’s fiancée. Unseen between its first television broadcast in 1970 and its rediscovery in 2002, The Niklashausen Journey chronicles the journey of a young peasant in the 15th century and his quest to overcome social injustice, in Fassbinder’s allegorical critique of the student movement. The American Soldier sees Fassbinder continue to pursue the cinephilic homage to classic Hollywood crime films of his feature debut, Love is Colder than Death, in a tale of a German-American Vietnam vet turned small-time hoodlum who finds himself on the wrong side of the law in Munich, where he grew up.Mother Küsters Goes to Heaven stars Brigitte Mira (Fear Eats the Soul) as a middle-aged housewife who is roused into revolutionary activity after her blue-collar husband runs amok at his workplace. Based on a story by Asta Scheib, Fear of Fear features Fassbinder favourite Margit Carstensen (The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant) as the young mother plagued with feelings of anxiety and depression as she is left to spend her hours alone surrounded by her judgemental in-laws while her husband spends his days at work. Satan’s Brew sees Fassbinder foray into riotous comedy, with Kurt Raab starring as a once famous poet stricken with writer’s block who inadvertently assumes the persona of the prewar symbolist Stefan George.Product FeaturesHigh Definition (1080p) Blu-ray presentations of Gods of the Plague, The American Soldier, Mother Küsters Goes to Heavenand Satan’s Brew prepared by the Rainer Werner Fassbinder FoundationOriginal uncompressed Pcm mono 1.0 sound for all filmsOptional English subtitles for all filmsReversible sleeves featuring newly commissioned artwork by Sister HydeDisc One - Gods Of The Plague & Rio Das MortesAlter Ego: Harry Baer on Rainer Werner Fassbinder, a 40-minute interview with the star of Gods of the PlagueTaking Off, an interview with Michael König on Rio Das MortesOriginal theatrical trailer for Gods of the PlagueDisc Two - The Niklashausen Journey & The American SoldierAudio commentary by critic Olaf Möller on The Niklashausen JourneyAudio commentary by critic Tony Rayns on The American SoldierFassbinder Shoots Film No 8, a 1971 television documentary by Michael Ballhaus and Dieter Buchmann on Rainer Werner Fassbinder filming The American SoldierThe Shadow Man, an in-depth interview with Fassbinder’s collaborator Michael FenglerFreedom or Death!, an interview with Michael König on The Niklashausen JourneyDisc Three - Mother Küsters Goes To Heaven & Fear Of FearAudio commentary by critic Olaf Möller on Mother Küsters Goes to HeavenInterviews with Renate Leiffer, assistant director on Mother Küsters Goes to Heaven and Fear of FearInterview with writer Asta Scheib on Fear of FearPlay It Again, Rainer!

Rainer Werner Fassbinder vol. 1 brings together a collection of his finest works from the early years of his career in High Definition digital restorations prepared by the Rainer Werner Fassbinder Foundation.His debut feature Love Is Colder Than Death (1969) is a playful but cynical crime picture, inspired by the nouvelle vague. Katzelmacher (1969) depicts the dynamics of a group of young layabout friends, which are radically altered by the arrival of an immigrant worker in their community. Beware of a Holy Whore (1971) pulls the curtain on the backstage dramas of the cast and crew of a film shoot as they wait in a Spanish seaside hotel for the arrival of funds to continue their production. The Merchant of Four Seasons (1971) portrays the downfall of a beleaguered fruit seller in 1950s Munich as he struggles to keep his family, body and soul together.Originally written and produced as a stage play, The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant (1972) focuses on the loves, losses and lamentations of the titular Petra, a successful fashion designer with two marriages behind her and an estranged daughter. The Ulli Lommel directed Tenderness of the Wolves (1973) sees Fassbinder adopting the role of producer in a bleak tale based on the German serial killer Fritz Haarmann, memorably played by Fassbinder regular Kurt Raab, who also wrote the screenplay.SPECIAL EDITION CONTENTSHigh definition digital transfers of all films prepared by the Rainer Werner Fassbinder FoundationHigh Definition (1080p) Blu-ray presentations of all filmsOriginal uncompressed PCM mono 1.0 sound for all filmsOptional English subtitles for all filmsReversible sleeves for all films featuring original and newly commissioned artwork by Sister HydeDISC ONE - LOVE IS COLDER THAN DEATH & KATZELMACHERTwo early short films by Rainer Werner Fassbinder from 1966, The Little Chaos and The City TrampInterview with actor Ulli Lommel on Love is Colder Than DeathEnd of the Commune?, Joachim von Mengershausen’s 1970 documentary portrait of Fassbinder and his troupe including rare footage of his actors rehearsing and Love Is Colder Than Death’s premiere at the 1969 Berlin Film FestivalOriginal theatrical trailer for KatzelmacherDISC TWO - THE MERCHANT OF FOUR SEASONS & BEWARE OF A HOLY WHOREAudio commentary on The Merchant of Four Seasons by critics Alexandra Heller-Nicholas and Christian McCreaAudio commentary on Beware of a Holy Whore by Adrian MartinInterview with actor Lou Castel on Beware of a Holy WhoreBeware of a Holy Whore theatrical trailerDISC THREE - THE BITTER TEARS OF PETRA VON KANTCommentary by filmmaker and lecturer Diane CharlesonLife Stories: A Conversation with R.W.

In Return of the Street Fighter, Tsurugi uncovers an extortion racket behind the construction of a new karate dojo and a shadowy cabal whose reach stretches across the whole of Asia.

During the interview, Kint tells Kujan of how he was recruited by the fearsome crime lord Keyser Söze to commit a series of daring heists with four other crooked misfits: Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne), Mike McManus (Stephen Baldwin), Fred Fenster (Benicio del Toro) and Todd Hockey (Kevin Pollak). But as Kint's account of the events leading up to the massacre becomes more convoluted, Kujan becomes increasingly sceptical and determined to discover the identity of the elusive Keyser Söze.With an unforgettably twisty and tightly written Oscar®-winning script by Christopher McQuarrie, The Usual Suspects is an unmissable entry in the canon of American indie cinema.LIMITED EDITION BLU-RAY CONTENTS4K restoration from the original negative approved by cinematographer Newton Thomas SigelHigh Definition Blu-ray (1080p) presentationOriginal lossless DTS-HD MA 5.1 and 2.0Optional English subtitles for the deaf and hard of hearingAudio commentary with director Bryan Singer and writer Christopher McQuarrieAudio commentary with editor and composer John OttmanThe Devil in the Details, an archival interview with Newton Thomas SigelArchival interview with John OttmanRound Up: Deposing the Usual Suspects, a two-part featurette delving into the creation and production of The Usual Suspects with clips, interviews with key figures, and footage from the making of the filmKeyser Söze (Lie or Legend?), an archival featuretteHeisting Cannes with The Usual Suspects, archival footage from the film's world premiere at the 1995 Cannes Film FestivalIntroducing The Usual Suspects, an original EPK featuretteDeleted scenes with introduction by John OttmanGag reelInterview outtakes with Chazz Palminteri, Stephen Baldwin, Kevin Pollak, Benicio del Toro, and Bryan SingerInternational trailerU.S. trailer with introduction by John OttmanTV spotsReversible sleeve featuring original and newly commissioned artwork by Tommy PocketCollector's booklet featuring new writing by Barry ForshawDouble-sided fold-out poster featuring original and newly commissioned artwork by Tommy Pocket",

Meanwhile, Tsukiko's new neighbor seems to be harboring something nasty in the downstairs apartment, something which rapidly begins to take on a dangerous form.Tomie is a creepy supernatural chiller directed by Ataru Oikawa (screenwriter of the pioneering Japanese horror Door) and featuring a chilling turn by the sensational Miho Kanno (Eko Eko Azarak: Wizard of Darkness, Dolls). Arrow Video is proud to present this key title from the J-Horror boom of the late 1990s, which spawned a string of sequels, for the first time on Blu-ray outside of Japan, with a host of newly produced extras.Product FeaturesLIMITED EDITION CONTENTSHigh Definition (1080p) Blu-ray presentationOriginal lossless 5.1 and 2.0 stereo audioOptional English subtitlesBrand new audio commentary by critic and Japanese cinema expert Amber T.It's a Girl's World, a brand new interview with director Ataru OikawaScream Queen, a brand new interview with actress Mami NakamuraFrom Manga to Screen, a brand new interview with producer Mikihiko HirataTrailerImage galleryIllustrated collector's booklet featuring new writing by Zack Davisson and Eugene ThackerReversible sleeve featuring original and newly commissioned artwork by Sara Deck",

V-Cinema Essentials: Bullets & Betrayal presents nine explosive titles representing some of the best the Japanese crime film has to offer.Fast-paced and action-packed, Crime Hunter: Bullets of Rage sees detective Joe Kawamura out for revenge against the men who gunned down his partner. Along the way he teams up with Lily, a gun-toting nun looking to get back five million dollars that was stolen from her church. Next up, Neo Chinpira: Zoom Goes the Bullet sees wannabe yakuza Junko get more than he bargained for when tasked with avenging the murder of a fellow gang member, or face the consequences for betrayal. Meanwhile, in Shunichi Nagasaki's unbearably tense thriller Stranger, a late-night taxi driver is stalked by the unseen driver of an SUV, who just might have a connection to the taxi driver's criminal past. In Carlos, the eponymous Brazilian-Japanese petty criminal sees an opportunity to play rival yakuza gangs against each other, but bites off much more than he can chew. Burning Dog is a gripping heist film where a gang of thieves plot to rob a US military base in Okinawa, but rising tensions in the group threaten to put the plan in jeopardy.The sequel to one of the most iconic Japanese franchises of all time, Female Prisoner Scorpion: Death Threat sees a female assassin hired to infiltrate a women's prison and search for The Scorpion, a legendary rebellious prisoner hiding in the bowels of the building. After his fiancée is killed in the crossfire of a yakuza turf war, a man on the edge remorselessly hunts down the gangsters responsible in legendary director Teruo Ishii's The Hitman: Blood Smells Like Roses. Meanwhile in Danger Point: The Road to Hell, duo of contract killers' fragile partnership is tested when their most recent hit starts to have unforeseen consequences. Finally, assassin and femme fatale Shion rebels against the fanatical religious order who prepared her from birth to be the perfect killer in the pulpy XX: Beautiful Hunter.Filled with action, thrills and double-crosses, V-Cinema Essentials: Bullets & Betrayal is an electrifying compendium of gems from the Japanese video underworld.Product FeaturesLIMITED EDITION CONTENTSHigh Definition (1080p) Blu-ray presentations of all filmsOriginal lossless Japanese mono audio on Crime Hunter: Bullets of Rage and original lossless Japanese stereo audio for all other filmsOptional newly translated English subtitles for all filmsNine postcard-sized artcardsLimited edition packaging with reversible sleeves featuring newly commissioned artwork by Chris MalbonIllustrated collector's booklet featuring new writing by Earl Jackson, Daisuke Miyao, and Hayley ScanlonDISC 1 - CRIME HUNTER: BULLETS OF RAGE / NEO CHINPIRA: ZOOM GOES THE BULLETNewly filmed introductions to both films by Japanese film critic Masaki TaniokaLoose Cannon, a newly filmed interview with Crime Hunter: Bullets of Rage director Shundo OkawaZooming Out, a newly filmed interview with Neo Chinpira: Zoom Goes the Bullet writer-director Banmei TakahashiCrime Hunter and the Dawn of V-Cinema, a brand new video essay on Crime Hunter: Bullets of Rage by Japanese cinema expert Tom MesOriginal trailers for both filmsDISC 2 - STRANGER / CARLOSNewly filmed introductions to both films by Japanese film critic Masaki TaniokaStranger than Fiction, a newly filmed interview with Stranger writer-director Shunichi NagasakiFrom Manga to Movies, a newly filmed interview with Carlos writer-director Kazuhiro KiuchiAn Extra Round in the Chamber, a brand new video essay on Carlos by critic and Japanese cinema expert Jonathan ClementsDISC 3 - BURNING DOG / FEMALE PRISONER SCORPION: DEATH THREATNewly filmed introductions to both films by Japanese film critic Masaki TaniokaFire and Ice, a brand new video essay on Burning Dog by critic and Japanese cinema expert Mark SchillingToshiharu Ikeda's Beautiful Monster of Vengeance, a brand new video essay on Female Prisoner Scorpion: Death Threat by film historian Samm DeighanOriginal trailers for both filmsDISC 4 - THE HITMAN: BLOOD SMELLS LIKE ROSES / DANGER POINT: THE ROAD TO HELLNewly filmed introductions to both films by Japanese film critic Masaki TaniokaThe Versatility of Teruo Ishii, a brand new video essay on The Hitman: Blood Smells Like Roses and its director Teruo Ishii by Japanese cinema expert Frankie BalboaThe Road to V-Cinema, a brand new video essay on Danger Point: The Road to Hell by critic and Japanese cinema expert James BalmontOriginal trailer for The Hitman: Blood Smells Like RosesDISC 5 - XX: BEAUTIFUL HUNTERNewly filmed introduction by Japanese film critic Masaki TaniokaThe Sacred and the Profane, a newly filmed interview with screenwriter Hiroshi TakahashiThey Brought Back the Sleaze, a brand new video essay on XX: Beautiful Hunter by critic and Japanese cinema expert Patrick MaciasOriginal trailer",

At once epic and intimate, it is a one-of-a-kind trip through the exhilaration of childhood, the seismic shifts of modern family life, and the passage of time itself.Dreamy-eyed grade-schooler Mason (Ellar Coltrane) is facing upheaval: his struggling single mom Olivia (Patricia Arquette) has decided to move him and older sister Samantha (Lorelei Linklater) to Houston - just as their long-absent father Mason Sr. (Ethan Hawke) re-enters their world. Thus begins a decade of constantly unfolding heartbreak and wonder. Against the tide of family moves and controversies, faltering marriages and re-marriages, new schools, first loves, lost loves, good times and scary times that will shape him, Mason emerges to find his own road in life.A remarkable achievement that builds on Linklater's fascination with time, relationships and the ever-changing nature of our lives, Boyhood is a deeply moving experience that found praise from critics around the world and went on to win the award for Best Film at both the Golden Globes and British Academy Film Awards in 2015.Product Features4K (2160p) UHD Blu-ray presentation in Dolby Vision (HDR10 compatible)Lossless DTS HD MA 5.1 audioOptional English subtitles for the deaf and hard of hearingWithout Ambition, One Starts Nothing, a new featurette featuring American poet and critic Dan Chiasson in conversation with his son Louis Chiasson about their shared love and connection to the filmIn Search of Lost Time, a new visual essay by critic and film-maker Scout TafoyaBefore and After Boyhood, a previously unheard interview with Richard Linklater by film critic Rob Stone, author of Walk, Don't Run: The Cinema of Richard LinklaterRichard Linklater at the BFI, director Richard Linklater discusses Boyhood and his whole career in this on stage appearance at the British Film InstituteTheatrical trailerImage galleryDouble-sided fold-out poster60-page perfect-bound collector's book featuring new writing on the film by film critic Ben Sachs and scholar Rob Stone, author of Walk, Don't Run: The Cinema of Richard Linklater",

    "description": "Arrow VideoFrom Richard Linklater, the director of Slacker, Dazed & Confused and Before Sunrise, Boyhood is a ground-breaking cinematic achievement; a fictional drama made with the same group of actors over a 12-year period. At once epic and intimate, it is a one-of-a-kind trip through the exhilaration of childhood, the seismic shifts of modern family life, and the passage of time itself.Dreamy-eyed grade-schooler Mason (Ellar Coltrane) is facing upheaval: his struggling single mom Olivia (Patricia Arquette) has decided to move him and older sister Samantha (Lorelei Linklater) to Houston - just as their long-absent father Mason Sr. (Ethan Hawke) re-enters their world. Thus begins a decade of constantly unfolding heartbreak and wonder. Against the tide of family moves and controversies, faltering marriages and re-marriages, new schools, first loves, lost loves, good times and scary times that will shape him, Mason emerges to find his own road in life.A remarkable achievement that builds on Linklater's fascination with time, relationships and the ever-changing nature of our lives, Boyhood is a deeply moving experience that found praise from critics around the world and went on to win the award for Best Film at both the Golden Globes and British Academy Film Awards in 2015.Product FeaturesHigh Definition Blu-ray (1080p) presentationLossless DTS HD MA 5.1 audioOptional English subtitles for the deaf and hard of hearingWithout Ambition, One Starts Nothing, a new featurette featuring American poet and critic Dan Chiasson in conversation with his son Louis Chiasson about their shared love and connection to the filmIn Search of Lost Time, a new visual essay by critic and film-maker Scout TafoyaBefore and After Boyhood, a previously unheard interview with Richard Linklater by film critic Rob Stone, author of Walk, Don't Run: The Cinema of Richard LinklaterRichard Linklater at the BFI, director Richard Linklater discusses Boyhood and his whole career in this on stage appearance at the British Film InstituteTheatrical trailerImage galleryDouble-sided fold-out poster60-page perfect-bound collector's book featuring new writing on the film by film critic Ben Sachs and scholar Rob Stone, author of Walk, Don't Run: The Cinema of Richard Linklater",

    "price": "£15.00",
    "description": "Arrow FilmsNobody loses all the time.Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia concluded a remarkable period for filmmaker Sam Peckinpah. It brought to an end a seven-year and seven-film run of masterpieces that included the taboo-breaking ultra-violence of The Wild Bunch and Straw Dogs, and the more elegiac tones of The Ballad of Cable Hogue and Junior Bonner. A love story that plays out in a brutal environment, Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia sits somewhere between these moods and may just be Bloody Sam s greatest work, as well as his most autobiographical.Warren Oates plays Bennie, a piano player in a Mexican bar who gets himself involved in the manhunt for Alfredo Garcia, a man with a million-dollar price-tag on his head having impregnated the daughter of crime boss El Jefe (Emilio Fernández). Sensing an easy pay day, Bennie takes his girlfriend, Elita (Isela Vega) on a trip that ll prove fatalistic for many of those involved.During a career that was blighted by studio interference, Peckinpah would later say that Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia was the only which ended up exactly as he wanted: I did it exactly the way I wanted to. Good or bad, like it or not, that was my film. And it was. This is as close to Pure Peckinpah as it gets beautiful, violent, troubling, heartbreaking, astonishing.",

    "description": "Arrow VideoIn 1974, Stephen King published his first novel, the story of Carrie White, a troubled young girl, bullied by her peers and daughter to a fanatical fundamentalist mother, who discovers she has telekinetic powers. In 1976, it became the first of his works to be adapted for the big screen and, to this day, remains one of the very best.Carrie marked Brian De Palma's arrival as a major director, following smaller cult films such as Sisters, Phantom of the Paradise and Obsession, and provided a key early role for Sissy Spacek (Badlands), one that would earn her a Best Actress nomination at the Academy Awards®. Piper Laurie would also pick up a nomination as Carrie's mother, while future stars such as Amy Irving, John Travolta and Nancy Allen were given their first major parts in a big-screen production.Restored in 4K from the original negative, this collector's edition provides the definitive release of a horror classic.Product Features4K restoration from the original camera negative4K (2160p) UHD Blu-rayTMpresentation in Dolby Vision (HDR10 compatible)Lossless mono and DTS-HD 5.1 Master Audio soundtracksOptional English subtitles for the deaf and hard of hearingCommentary by Lee Gambin, author of Nope, Nothing Wrong Here: The Making of Cujo, and Alexandra Heller-Nicholas, author of Cultographies: Ms. 45 and Devil's Advocates: SuspiriaActing Carrie - archive featurette containing interviews with director Brian De Palma, actors Sissy Spacek, Piper Laurie, Amy Irving, William Katt and othersMore Acting Carrie - additional interviews with the cast of the filmVisualising Carrie: From Words to Images - archive featurette containing interviews with De Palma, writer Lawrence D.

When they find themselves attending the same event (Ashley working as a waiter at Veronica's rich husband's party), their initial thinly-veiled verbal pleasantries soon take a turn, leading to an all-out brawl and all-consuming rivalry that will keep these two locked in combat for years.With supporting appearances from Alicia Silverstone as Ashley's lesbian love interest, and Dylan Baker playing an overworked coma doctor, Catfight turns the portrayal of women's fights in movies on its head in the most violent of ways possible, landing a killer satirical blow at modern day society.SPECIAL EDITION CONTENTS:High Definition Blu-ray (1080p) presentationOptional subtitles for the deaf and hard of hearingCommentary with writer-editor-director Onur TukelCommentary with actors Sandra Oh and Anne HecheFight Choreography featuretteDeleted ScenesTrailerReversible sleeve featuring original and newly commissioned artwork by The Red Dress",

Nair, a man whose childhood fascination with cinema finally led to the creation of the National Film Archive of India. In a country where film preservation was once regarded as irrelevant, Nair's has been a long, hard fight to preserve precious fragments of India's film heritage that would otherwise be lost forever.Comparable to France's late, great 'man of cinema', the noted film archivist Henri Langlois, Nair has also influenced generations of Indian filmmakers by introducing them to new worlds through the prism of cinema. Featuring wonderful clips and interviews with many Indian and international filmmakers, this award-winning documentary is both a portrait of a man's passion with film and a love letter to cinema itself.This illuminating documentary is presented on DVD for the first time anywhere in the world.The DVD features a new, director-approved digital transfer of the film, and includes a newly filmed, exclusive interview with the director, Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound option and an accompanying booklet with an essay by Mark Cousins and extracts from the director's own production diaries.",

And then he discovers a cache of letters from an ex-boyfriend, accompanied by a highly revealing and very public photograph of her...Ravishingly shot in two of the world's great cities, bouncily scored by Pino Donaggio, and crammed with wall-to-wall nudity and casual sexual flings, Cheeky is as lighthearted as its title suggests, but it's subtler and more philosophical than the average sex romp.In particular, it's a genuinely moving look at problems arising when a desire to remain scrupulously faithful collides with the lure of baser instincts. Carla genuinely loves Matteo, but how can she reassure him when he spots temptation around every corner?",

No Hope.Academy Award®-winner Alfonso Cuaron (Gravity, Y Tu Mamá También) is renowned for his bold and ambitious camerawork, pushing technology to its limits in his pursuit of cinematic truth. With 2006 s Children of Men, he delivers one of the most chilling and visceral works of cinematic speculative fiction in recent memory.In 2027, following eighteen years of global human infertility, the world is a bleak and hostile place. Former activist Theo (Clive Owen, Gosford Park, Shadow Dancer) drifts through the violence-riven streets of London without hope or purpose. However, when he reluctantly agrees to help former lover Julian (Julianne Moore, The Fugitive) smuggle a miraculously pregnant woman out of the country, he is unwittingly thrust into the role of all that stands between the human race and its extinction. As the country descends into anarchy and the authorities close in, Theo must race against time to secure safe passage for the humanity s only hope of salvation.Based on the dystopian novel by P.D. James and co-starring Michael Caine (Pulp) and Clare-Hope Ashitey (Seven Seconds), Children of Men offers a powerful and frightening glimpse at a future that, more than a decade later, feels even more chillingly prescient than at the time of its original release.Special FeaturesHigh Definition Blu-ray (1080p) presentation Original 5.1 DTS-HD master audio Optional English subtitles for the deaf and hard of hearing New audio commentary by author and critic Bryan Reesman There is No Future, a new video appreciation by film historian Philip Kemp Fertility & Progeny, a new video essay by author and critic Kat Ellinger The Possibility of Hope, an archival documentary featuring interviews with activist Naomi Klein, philosopher Slavoj i ek and others, exploring the film s resonance with contemporary current affairs Comments by Slavoj i ek, an archival featurette on the film s themes Creating the Baby, an archival featurette on the film s visual effects Futuristic Design, an archival featurette on the film s sets Theo & Julian, an archival featurette on Clive Owen, Julianne Moore and their characters Under Attack, an archival featurette on the film s ground-breaking camerawork Deleted scenes Image gallery Reversible sleeve featuring original and newly commissioned artwork by Corey Brickley.",

    "title": "Cinema Of Conflict | Four Films By Krzystof Kieślowski | Blu-ray",
    "price": "£20.00",
    "description": "Arrow FilmsFew names are as synonymous with Polish cinema as that of Krzysztof Kieślowski, the renowned auteur responsible for the Dekalog and the Three Colours trilogy. Prior to the fall of the Berlin Wall and his subsequent creative and critical success in France, Kieślowski plied his trade within the confines of the Eastern Bloc, capturing the realities of everyday life under Soviet rule. This collection gathers his four earliest narrative feature films, encapsulating the years 1976–1984.In 1976's The Scar, a well-intentioned Party loyalist is charged with overseeing the construction of a new chemical plant in the face of fierce resistance and is forced to confront the conflict between his good intentions and local opposition. In 1979's Camera Buff, a family man and amateur filmmaker experiences a dramatic change in fortunes when his newfound hobby opens up new horizons but also results in deep marital and philosophical conflicts. Blind Chance, completed in 1981 and denied a release in its native Poland until 1987, presents three possible outcomes to a single, seemingly banal event – a young medical student running to catch a train – and, in the process, explores the relationship between chance and choice. Finally, in 1984's No End, a recently bereaved translator juggles the conflicting demands of her work, caring for her son and her continued visions of her late husband, all against the backdrop of a Poland under the grip of martial law.As socially conscious as Kieślowski's earlier documentary shorts, this quartet of films covers a tumultuous period in Polish and Eastern European history, shot with unflinching realism by a filmmaker of distinction.Special Features:High Definition Blu-ray (1080p) presentations of all four filmsOriginal lossless mono audio for all filmsOptional English subtitles for all filmsAudio commentary on Camera Buff by Annette Insdorf, author of Double Lives, Second Chances: The Cinema of Krzysztof KieślowskiAudio commentary on Blind Chance by film historian Michael BrookeGhost of a Chance, a visual essay on No End by Adrian Martin and Cristina Álvarez LópezMoral and Martial Anxieties, a discussion with Michael Brooke, exploring the brief and remarkable Polish film renaissance of the turn of the 1980sIntroductions by scholar and critic Michał Oleszczyk to all filmsMichał Oleszczyk looks through archive materials for each filmArchival interviews with filmmakers Agnieszka Holland and Krzysztof Zanussi, cinematographers Slawomir Idziak and Jacek Petrycki, actress Grażyna Szapołowska, sound designer Michal Zarnecki, critic Annette Insdorf and Kieślowski collaborator Irena StrzałkowskaThree short films by Kieślowski: The Office (1966), Concert of Requests (1967) and Talking Heads (1980)Workshop Exercises, a 1987 short film by Marcel Łoziński, Kieślowski's colleague at the Warsaw Documentary Film StudioReversible sleeves featuring original and newly commissioned artwork by Corey Brickley",

Having played Frankenstein's Monster, Count Dracula and The Mummy for Hammer, this new picture would allow him to extend his range to the American Gothic – and witchcraft in a small New England village…Lee plays Professor Driscoll, an authority on the occult who persuades one of his students (Venetia Stevenson) to research his hometown, Whitewood, once the site of witch burnings in the 17th century. Booking herself into the Raven's Inn, she soon learns that devil worship among the locals hasn't been consigned to the past.Produced by future Amicus founders Milton Subotsky and Max Rosenberg, and beautifully shot by Desmond Dickinson (whose credits ranged from Laurence Olivier's Hamlet to Horrors of the Black Museum), The City of the Dead is a wonderfully atmospheric and still shocking slice of horror that stands firmly alongside with its Hammer contemporaries.Special FeaturesNew 4K digital restoration by the Cohen Film Collection and the BFIHigh Definition Blu-ray (1080p) and Standard Definition DVD presentations of two versions of the film: The City of the Dead and the alternative US cut, Horror HotelUncompressed Mono 1.0 PCM AudioOptional English subtitles for the deaf and hard of hearingAudio commentary by film critic Jonathan Rigby, author of English Gothic: Classic Horror Cinema 1897-2015 and Christopher Lee: An Authorised Screen History, recorded exclusively for this releaseTrailerReversible sleeve featuring original and newly commissioned artwork by Graham HumphreysMORE TO BE ANNOUNCED!",

Rapidly changing technology and an overcrowded marketplace have led to an industry in which anyone can now make a film, but few can make a living.Following five years in the life and career of independent filmmaker Justin McConnell (Lifechanger), this documentary explores the struggles of financing, attracting the right talent, working with practical effects and selling the finished product in the hope of turning a profit.Featuring interviews with a range of industry luminaries – including Guillermo del Toro (Crimson Peak), Sid Haig (Spider Baby), Barbara Crampton (Re-Animator), Mick Garris (The Stand), Dick Miller (Matinee), Tom Holland (Fright Night) and George A.

One of the property’s residents, Dennis Nilsen – a mild-mannered and unassuming civil servant – is brought in for questioning, leading to the discovery of one of the most shocking and disturbing cases of serial murder ever to rock Britain.Offering a grim and gritty retelling of the story of “Des” Nilsen, often dubbed the “British Jeffery Dahmer”, 1989’s Cold Light of Day stars Bob Flag (the face of Big Brother in Michael Radford’s 1984) as Nilsen-cipher Jorden March, delivering one of the most chilling and credible portrayals of a serial killer ever committed to screen.From writer-director Fhiona-Louise, Cold Light of Day – which picked up the UCCA Venticittà Award at the 1990 Venice International Film Festival – is a hugely underseen and underrated British effort that can stand proudly alongside the likes of Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer as one of the most unflinching true-crime films of all time.LIMITED EDITION CONTENTSLimited Edition of 2000 unitsBrand new 2K restoration from the original 16mm camera negative approved by director Fhiona-LouiseOriginal uncompressed mono audioOptional English subtitles for the deaf and hard of hearingBrand new audio commentary with writer/director Fhiona-LouiseBrand new audio commentary with film historians/writers Dean Brandum and Andrew NetteNewly-filmed interview with actor Martin Byrne-QuinnNewly-filmed interview with actor Steve MunroeOriginal Cold Light of Day promo film made to raise financing for the featureRe-Release TrailerTwo short films starring Cold Light of Day director Fhiona-Louise and photographed by Star Wars DP David Tattershall, newly restored in HD: Metropolis Apocalypse (1988, 11 mins) and Sleepwalker (1993, 2 mins)Reversible sleeve featuring original and newly-commissioned artwork by Gilles VranckxLimited Edition Die-cut O-cardLimited Edition collector’s booklet featuring new writing on the film by Jo Botting and a look at how the press reported Dennis Nilsen’s real-life crimes by Jeff Billington",

    "description": "Arrow FilmsConsidered by many to be director Kinji Fukasaku's greatest single-film achievement in the yakuza genre, Cops vs Thugs was made at the height of popularity of Toei Studios' jitsuroku boom: realistic, modern crime movies based on true stories taken from contemporary headlines. Returning to the screen after completing their Battles Without Honor and Humanity series together, Fukasaku joined forces once again with screenwriter Kazuo Kasahara, composer Toshiaki Tsushima and star Bunta Sugawara to create one of the crowning achievements of his career, and a hard-boiled classic which is still ranked as one of the best Japanese films of the 1970's.It's 1963 in the southern Japanese city of Kurashima, and tough-as-nails detective Kuno (Sugawara) oversees a detente between the warring Kawade and Ohara gangs. Best friends with Ohara lieutenant Hirotani (Hiroki Matsukata), he understands that there are no clear lines in the underworld, and that everything is colored a different shade of gray. But when random violence interrupts the peace and an ambitious, by-the-books lieutenant (Tatsuo Umemiya) comes to town, Kuno's fragile alliance begins to crumble. Greedy bosses and politicians alike seize the opportunity to wipe out their enemies, and Kuno faces the painful choice of pledging allegiance to his badge and keeping a promise to his brother.Echoing the great crime films of Sidney Lumet and Jean-Pierre Melville, in Fukasaku's world, there's no honor among thieves or lawmen alike, and the only thing that matters is personal honor and duty among friends. Kasahara's shattering screenplay and Fukasaku's dynamic direction support an all-star, ensemble cast to create one of the most exciting, and deeply moving films about cops and criminals ever made.Special FeaturesHigh Definition digital transferHigh Definition Blu-ray (1080p) and Standard Definition DVD presentationsOriginal uncompressed mono audioOptional English subtitlesAudio commentary by film scholar Tom MesNew video interview with film scholar & Fukasaku biographer Sadao YamaneSympathy for the Underdog, a new visual essay on Fukasaku's career by Marc WalkowReversible sleeve featuring original and newly commissioned artwork by Ian MacEwan",

His dream star vehicle: a big-screen adaptation of Fyodor Dostoyevsky s most famous novel Crime And Punishment. His choice of director: Josef von Sternberg, already celebrated and castigated in equal measure for his seven-film collaboration with Marlene Dietrich.Roderick Raskolnikov (Lorre) has graduated from university as a noted expert in criminology, but nonetheless lives in extreme poverty. Desperate and anguished, he murders a miserly pawnbroker, stealing her valuables before fleeing into the night. The next day, he encounters Inspector Porfiry (Edward Arnold), the detective assigned to the murder, and is asked by Porfiry to consult on the case when an innocent man is arrested as a suspect. How long until the conflicted, guilt-ridden Raskolnikov arouses the master detective s suspicions?One of many attempts at the time by Hollywood studios to give cinema an air of prestige by adapting great works of literature, Von Sternberg s stylish direction and Lorre s tour-de-force performance are ready for rediscovery in this Blu-Ray premiere of their only collaboration.",

    "description": "Arrow FilmsShe is watched. She is worshipped. And she must remain a mystery.In the early eighties British enfant terrible Ken Russell travelled to America and placed his unorthodox imprint on a pair of US movies. The first was the Altered States, so out-there its screenwriter disowned it. The second was the equally crazy Crimes of Passion, starring Kathleen Turner (Body Heat, Serial Mom) at the height of her powers.Fashion designer Joanna Crane (Turner) leads a double life. By night she is China Blue, a prostitute who s attracted the unwanted attention of two men. One is a sexually frustrated private detective hired by her employees. The other is psychopathic priest (played by Norman Bates himself, Anthony Perkins) in possession of a murderous sex toy. With its outré screenplay by Barry Sandler and over the top score by Rick Wakeman, Crimes of Passion may just be the most outrageous Ken Russell film ever made and that s quite some feat!Special Edition ContentsBrand new 2K restoration of the film from original film materialsHigh Definition Blu-ray (1080p) and Standard Definition DVD presentations of the 112-minute director s cut and 107-minute unrated versions of the filmOptional subtitles for the deaf and hard of hearingAudio commentary with director Ken Russell and producer-screenwriter Barry SandlerSeven deleted/extended scenes with optional commentary by SandlerBrand-new interview with Sandler recorded especially for this releaseBrand-new interview with composer Rick Wakeman recorded especially for this release It s a Lovely Life music videoTheatrical trailerReversible sleeve featuring original and newly commissioned artwork by Twins of Evil",

    "description": "Arrow FilmsFrom the imagination of Oscar-winning director Guillermo del Toro (Pan's Labyrinth, The Shape of Water) comes Crimson Peak, a lavish, stunningly realized journey into the dark heart of Gothic romance...Beginning in Buffalo, New York, during the 1880s, Crimson Peak stars Mia Wasikowska (Alice in Wonderland, Stoker) as Edith Cushing, an aspiring writer who is haunted by the death of her mother. Edith falls in love with seductive stranger Thomas Sharpe (Tom Hiddleston, The Avengers), who whisks her off to Allerdale Hall, his baronial, yet dilapidated English mansion built upon a mountain of blood-red clay. Here Edith meets Lucille (Jessica Chastain, Zero Dark Thirty), Thomas's sister who at times seems hostile and jealous. As Edith struggles to feel at home in the imposing residence, she gradually uncovers a horrendous family secret and encounters supernatural forces that will help her discover the terrible truth behind Crimson Peak.Boasting incredibly intricate and ornate production design and a rich visual style, del Toro's film is a grandiose, boldly baroque triumph of Gothic decadence, which expertly combines and contrasts the sublimely beautiful with the shockingly grotesque. Crimson Peak is presented here with a wealth of extra features, affording unprecedented insight into the making of this modern Gothic classic.Special Edition Content:High Definition Blu-ray (1080p) presentationOriginal 7.1 DTS:X and 2.0 DTS Headphone:X audioOptional English subtitles for the deaf and hard of hearingOptional Descriptive Video Service® (DVS®) for the visually impairedAudio commentary by co-writer and director Guillermo del ToroThe House is Alive: Constructing Crimson Peak, a feature-length documentary with cast and crew interviews and extensive behind the scenes footageSpanish language interview with Guillermo del ToroThe Gothic Corridor, The Scullery, The Red Clay Mines, The Limbo Fog Set; four featurettes exploring different aspects of Allerdale HallA Primer on Gothic Romance, the director and stars talk about the key traits of Gothic romanceThe Light and Dark of Crimson Peak, the cast and crew talk about the film's use of colorHand Tailored Gothic, a featurette on the film's striking costumesA Living Thing, a look at the design, modeling and construction of the Allerdale Hall setsBeware of Crimson Peak, a walking tour around Allerdale Hall with Tom HiddlestonCrimson Phantoms, a featurette on the film's amazing ghostsKim Newman on Crimson Peak and the Tradition of Gothic Romance, an interview with the author and criticViolence and Beauty in Guillermo del Toro's Gothic Fairy Tale Films, a video essay by the writer Kat EllingerDeleted scenesImage galleryOriginal trailers and TV spotsReversible sleeve featuring original and exclusive artwork by Artist Guy Davis",

Often concerned with relationships between marginal and marginalised characters, Cote s work is consistently imaginative and invigorating.Winner of the Best Director and Best Actor (Emmanuel Bilodeau) awards at the 2010 Locarno International Film Festival, Curling is set on the fringes of society, in a remote part of rural Québec. The film examines the unusual private life of Jean-François, a single father, who works at a deserted bowling alley at night and in a rundown motel during the day, and his daughter, Julyvonne, who he insists never leaves their home. Their isolation, and the fragile balance of their relationship, is jeopardised by Julyvonne s encroaching adolescence and her curiosity about the outside world that Jean-François so fears.Special FeaturesCurling (2010) presented from a brand new HD transfer of the film, approved by the directorNew filmed interview with director Denis Côté.May We Sleep Soundly (Que nous nous assoupissions, 2015) - Côté s acclaimed short film.Booklet featuring writing by film critic Adam Nayman and Robert McSorley, Executive Director of the Canadian Film Institute.Region free Blu-ray (A/B/C)Original soundtrack in 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio & 2.0 Stereo LPCM (16-bit)World premiere on Blu-ray",

Years later, he invited Menzel to meet him in a Prague café - and so began a conversation and a friendship that has culminated in this epic, seven-hour film that not only explores the deceptively whimsical comic films of Jiri Menzel, but all of the artists who strove to make films that whispered subversion and rebellion often at the risk of their livelihood, or even their lives.Filmed over a period of seven years, Dungarpur and his team interviewed filmmakers, actors, crew members, writers, historians and critics who had been touched by the New Wave - including V ra Chytilová, Milo Forman, Vojt ch Jasný, Ivan Passer, Ken Loach, Juraj Jakubisko, Jaromír ofr, Andrzej Wajda, Du an Hanák, tefan Uher, Jan N mec, and Miroslav Ond í ek among them.CzechMate In Search of Ji í Menzel reminds us of the genius, originality and bravery of the artists of the Czech Miracle , one of the most important and influential movements in the history of cinema.Special FeaturesCzechMate In Search of Jiri Menzel (2018) presented from a director-approved HD transferJiri Menzel short films:Prefabricated Houses (Domy z panel , 1960)Our Mr. Foerster Died (Um el nám pan Foerster, 1962)Image galleryBooklet featuring extracts from the diaries of filmmaker Shivendra Singh DungarpurRegion free Blu-ray (A/B/C)5.1 DTS-HD Master AudioWorld premiere on Blu-ray",

When they move into a new home within a dilapidated and long-forgotten apartment complex, Yoshimi begins to experience startling visions and unexplainable sounds, calling her mental well-being into question, and endangering not only her custody of Ikuko, but perhaps their lives as well.Beautifully shot by cinematographer Junichiro Hayashi (Ring, Pulse), and featuring an especially unnerving sound design, Dark Water successfully merges spine-tingling tension with a family's heart-wrenching emotional struggle, creating one of the very finest and most unsettling contemporary Japanese horror films.Product Features4K (2160p) Ultra HD Blu-ray presentation in Dolby Vision (HDR10 compatible)Original lossless 5.1 DTS-HD Master AudioOptional English subtitlesGhosts, Rings and Water - interview with director Hideo NakataFamily Terrors - interview with author Koji SuzukiVisualizing Horror - interview with cinematographer Junichiro HayashiArchive interviews with actors Hitomi Kuroki & Asami Mizukawa and theme song artist Shikao SugaOriginal 'making-of' documentaryTrailers and TV SpotsReversible sleeve featuring original and newly commissioned artwork by Peter StrainIllustrated collector's booklet featuring writing on the film by David Kalat and Michael Gingold",

InCrimes of theFuture (1970) Cronenberg worked in colour and with a larger budget, where we find the House of Skin clinic director (Ronald Mlodzik, returning fromStereo) searching for his mentor, Antoine Rouge, who has disappeared following a catastrophic plague.Cronenberg's early amateur feature films, shot in and around his university campus, prefigure his later films' concerns with strange institutions, male/female separation and ESP, echoing the likes ofVideodrome,Dead RingersandScanners.",

When legendarily ruthless master gunfighter Frank Talby (Van Cleef) rides into town, Scott seizes the opportunity to lift himself out of the gutter, and possibly even surpass Talby s own skills. But what is Talby doing in Clifton in the first place?This lively, intelligent western, notable for the chemistry between its charismatic leads, some memorable action set-pieces (including a rifle duel on horseback that has to be seen to be believed), and a jazzy Riz Ortolani score, is presented here in an exclusive high-definition restoration from the original Techniscope negative.",

All the hallmarks of late master of Spanish macabre José Ramón Larraz (Edge of the Axe, Vampyres) are present and correct in 1990's Deadly Manor - the final horror movie from one of the genre's most unheralded filmmakers.Whilst en route to a lake, a group of youngsters make an unscheduled stop-off at a remote, seemingly abandoned mansion where they plan to spend the night. But the property is full of foreboding signs - a blood-stained car wreck in the garden, coffins in the basement, scalps in the closet, and photographs of a beautiful but mysterious woman adorning every corner of the house. Before daybreak, the group will unwittingly uncover the strange and terrifying truth that lurks behind the walls of this dreadful place.The last in a trio of transcontinental slice-and-dice co-productions helmed by Larraz towards the end of the 80s (all of which which he directed under the anglicized moniker of Joseph Braunstein), Deadly Manor - released on VHS in the US under the title Savage Lust - is a fitting capper to the director's prolific career in fear, now finally unearthed for the first time on Blu-ray.SPECIAL EDITION CONTENTSBrand new 2K restoration from original film elementsHigh Definition Blu-ray (1080p) presentationOriginal uncompressed mono audioOptional English subtitles for the deaf and hard of hearingBrand new audio commentary with Kat Ellinger and Samm DeighanNewly-filmed interview with actress Jennifer DeloraMaking a Killing - a newly-filmed interview with producer Brian Smedley-AstonExtract from an archival interview with Jose LarrazOriginal \"Savage Lust\" VHS trailerImage GalleryOriginal Script and Shooting Schedule (BD-ROM content)Reversible sleeve featuring original and newly commissioned artwork by Adam Rabalais",

    "description": "Arrow FilmsThe last defence. The last hope. The battle for the future of the world has begun.In the 1980s, faced with the demise of the drive-in and the rise of the multiplex, New World Pictures – the independent studio established by Roger Corman – increasingly relied on smaller-scale productions, made with an eye to the cable TV and home video markets. Among these was Def-Con 4, an example of so-called \"Canuxploitation\" or Canadian exploitation cinema, riding on the coat-tails of the boom in post-apocalyptic disaster movies that began in the previous decade.Two months after the planet is ravaged by nuclear war, astronauts Howe (Tim Choate), Jordan (Kate Lynch, The Twilight Zone) and Walker (John Walsch, Blow Out) are forced to return to earth – now an apocalyptic wasteland consumed by radiation and roamed by cannibal gangs. Forced into desperate pacts with unlikely allies, among them eccentric survivalist Vinny (Maury Chaykin, WarGames), the astronauts must draw on all their resourcefulness to survive this brave new world.Bearing more than a passing resemblance to George Miller's Ozploitation classic Max Mad, Def-Con 4 is an inventive and action-packed low budget sci-fi romp, elevated by a pounding score by New World stalwart Christopher Young (Hellraiser) and making its UK High Definition debut with this brand new restoration from Arrow Films.Special FeaturesBrand new 2K restoration from the original 35mm interpositiveHigh Definition Blu-ray (1080p) presentationOriginal lossless mono soundtrackOptional English subtitles for the deaf and hard of hearingBrave New World, a new video interview with New World Pictures editor Michael SpenceNemesis Descending, a new video interview with composer Christopher YoungNew video interview with author Chris Poggiali on the history and legacy of New World PicturesTheatrical trailerReversible sleeve featuring original and newly commissioned artwork by Gary Pullin",

On her path to recovery, she takes a job in a care centre supporting adults with special needs, among them Stephanie (Stephanie Kinkle), a woman with Down syndrome. Convinced that the \"devils\" are coming for Stephanie, and tormented by flashbacks of her experience within the cult and with their leader Larry (Larry Fessenden, The Dead Don't Die, Habit), Katie takes increasingly extreme measures to ward off the evil that is making Stephanie sick. But what if her rituals are doing more harm than good?Raw and unsettling, Dementer is a brave and unflinching story of lives lived on the fringes of society, and a battle with demons inside and out.

While much of his latter-day output went straight to video, these low-budget productions nonetheless offer up some diamonds in the rough, among them his 1990 tale of rampaging Satanic Sisters – Demonia, regarded by many as his last great film.A Canadian archaeological team, led by Professor Evans (Brett Halsey, The Devil's Honey), descends on the ruins of a medieval Sicilian monastery to undertake an excavation. But when Evans' protégé, Liza (Meg Register, Ministry of Vengeance), goes searching for an explanation to the disturbing visions she's been experiencing, she awakens the spirit of three Satan-worshiping nuns put to death centuries earlier by a violent mob, unleashing an orgy of vengeful violence on the unsuspecting explorers.Originally destined for a theatrical release, Demonia is a return to the atmosphere and gory excesses of Fulci's late 70s/early 80s output – a no-holds-barred Satanic shocker co-starring Lino Salemme (Demons) and Al Cliver (Zombie Flesh Eaters) and co-written by Piero Regnoli (Burial Ground) – presented here in a pristine restoration and accompanied, in this exclusive limited edition, by the feature-length documentary Fulci Talks, assembled from an in-depth archival interview with the man himself!Product FeaturesHigh Definition Blu-ray (1080p) presentationDeluxe crucifix-style packaging featuring original and newly commissioned artwork by Graham HumphreysIllustrated collector's booklet featuring new writing on the film by author and critic Kat EllingerDISC 1: DEMONIA4K restoration from the original 35mm camera negativeRestored original lossless mono English and Italian soundtracksOptional English subtitles for the deaf and hard of hearing for the English soundtrackEnglish subtitles for the Italian soundtrackAudio commentary by Stephen Thrower, author of Beyond Terror: The Films of Lucio FulciHoly Demons, a video interview with uncredited co-writer/assistant director Antonio TentoriOf Skulls and Bones, a video interview with camera operator Sandro GrossiFulci Lives!!!, camcorder footage of a visit to the Demonia set, including an interview with Lucio FulciOriginal trailerDISC 2: FULCI TALKSFulci Talks, a feature-length 2021 documentary by filmmaker Antonietta De Lillo, based on an in-depth, career spanning video interview with Lucio Fulci from 1993, conducted by De Lillo and critic Marcello GarofaloOriginal lossless mono Italian soundtrackOptional English subtitles",

Initially dismissed as a country bumpkin (complete with straw hat and live pig in tow!), Kano soon proves himself a more savvy detective than the local cops, and a tougher customer than anyone expected. As he probes deeper into the sleazy world of flesh-peddling, talent agency corruption and mob influence, Kano uncovers the shocking truth about the girl, her connection to a yakuza-turned-music manager (Hiroki Matsukata), and a savage serial killer who is burning women alive.Made to appeal both to the youth market with its biker gangs and popular music, as well as to old-time yakuza movie fans, Doberman Cop is an surprising oddity in Fukasaku's career, his sole film adapted directly from a manga and never before released on video outside of Japan. Featuring Chiba at his charismatic best - channeling a Japanese Dirty Harry while doing all his own stunts - and Fukasaku at his most fun, deftly showcasing the combined talents of his \"Piranha Army\" stock company of actors and other regular players - Doberman Cop is a classic action comedy and a missing link in 1970's Japanese cinema deserving of rediscovery.Special FeaturesHigh Definition digital transferHigh Definition Blu-ray (1080p) and Standard Definition DVD presentationsOriginal uncompressed mono audioOptional English subtitlesBeyond the Film: Doberman Cop, a new video appreciation by Fukasaku biographer Sadao YamaneNew video interview with actor Shinichi \"Sonny\" ChibaNew video interview with screenwriter Koji TakadaReversible sleeve featuring original and newly commissioned artwork by Chris Malbon",

Initially beset with distribution problems, it would slowly find its audience and emerge as arguably the first cult classic of the new millennium.Donnie is a troubled high school student: in therapy, prone to sleepwalking and in possession of an imaginary friend, a six-foot rabbit named Frank, who tells him the world is going to end in 28 days, 06 hours, 42 minutes and 12 seconds. During that time he will navigate teenage life, narrowly avoid death in the form of a falling jet engine, follow Frank's maladjusted instructions and try to maintain the space-time continuum.Described by its director as \"The Catcher in the Rye as told by Philip K.

    "description": "Arrow FilmsIn the post-war years, the proliferation of transnational European co-productions gave rise to a cross-pollination of genres, with the same films sold in different markets as belonging to different movements. Among these, Riccardo Freda (I vampiri, The Horrible Dr. Hichock)'s Double Face was marketed in West Germany as an Edgar Wallace 'krimi', while in Italy it was sold as a giallo in the tradition of Mario Bava's Blood and Black Lace, combining elements from both genres for a unique and unforgettable viewing experience.When wealthy businessman John Alexander (the legendary Klaus Kinski, giving an atypically restrained performance)'s unfaithful wife Helen (Margaret Lee, Circus of Fear) dies in a car crash, it initially looks like a freak accident. However, the plot thickens when evidence arises suggesting that the car was tampered with prior to the crash. And John's entire perception of reality is thrown into doubt when he discovers a recently-shot pornographic movie which appears to feature Helen – suggesting that she is in fact alive and playing an elaborate mind game on him…Psychological, psychedelic, and at times just plain psychotic, Double Face stands as one of the most engaging and enjoyable films in Freda's lengthy and diverse career – a densely-plotted, visually-stunning giallo that evokes much of the same ambience of paranoia and decadence as such classics of the genre as One on Top of the Other and A Lizard in a Woman's Skin.Special FeaturesBrand new 2K restoration of the full-length Italian version of the film from the original 35mm camera negativeHigh Definition Blu-ray (1080p) presentationUncompressed mono 1.0 LPCM audioOriginal English and Italian soundtracks, titles and creditsNewly translated English subtitles for the Italian soundtrackOptional English subtitles for the deaf and hard of hearing for the English soundtrackNew audio commentary by author and critic Tim LucasNew video interview with composer Nora OrlandiThe Many Faces of Nora Orlandi, a new appreciation of the varied career of the film's composer by musician and soundtrack collector Lovely JonThe Terrifying Dr. Freda, a new video essay on Riccardo Freda's gialli by author and critic Amy SimmonsExtensive image gallery from the collection of Christian Ostermeier, including the original German pressbook and lobby cards, and the complete Italian cineromanzo adaptationOriginal Italian and English theatrical trailersReversible sleeve featuring original and newly commissioned artwork by Graham Humphreys",

A reclusive potter, Martin Lepi - nicknamed 'Dragon' - returns to his isolated community years after being wrongly accused of a crime, punished and shunned by his village. His return immediately engenders an atmosphere of suspicion, fear, and simmering violence. Gre ner's hauntingly poetic film is also a revealing account of peasant life in a world isolated from history and the mainstream of socio-political events - beautifully realised by Vincent Rosinec s luminous monochrome cinematography, and enhanced by an award-winning score from Ilja Zeljenka. The story based on Dobroslav Chrobák s 1940s novella - was later adapted by filmmaker Alain Robbe-Grillet in The Man Who Lies (L homme qui ment, 1968), and Eden and After (L'éden et après, 1970).The fourth in a series of essential Slovak classic films to be released by Second Run DVD.\"A compelling film, surely as exciting today as it was originally\" Senses of Cinema\"A beautifully poetic piece, big on atmosphere and intense psychological reflection...

They made five films in five years, all of which have become cornerstones of American comedy.In their last film for Paramount the four brothers gave us what many regard to be one of the greatest comedies of all time, Duck Soup. Directed by one of the most exceptional of all Hollywood comedy directors, Leo McCarey, Duck Soup sees the Marx clan spinning a satirical tale of war and war-makers as Groucho's Rufus Firefly declares war on the neighbouring state of Sylvania.The Paramount era represents the Marx Brothers at their absolute finest, retaining all of the energy and controlled chaos of their stage shows.

    "description": "Arrow FilmsShot in 1967, David Holzman's Diary is a milestone in contemporary film history.  Brilliantly conceived and executed, it manages to simultaneously be very much of its time and very many years ahead of its time.The film tells the story of David Holzman, a young man infatuated with film and filmmaking.  Newly unemployed and beset with doubts and worries, Holzman thinks that filming his everyday existence will 'bring life into focus'.  Staged to seem like a documentary of a real person's life, Holzman's filming of his life starts to take over his life.Arguably the first 'mockumentary', it has been little seen but hugely influential on filmmakers over the years.  The film is also enormously prescient about our current times, when seemingly everyone records everything to do with their lives for the camera.Selected for preservation by the US National Film Registry, this is the first time this classic of American cinema has been released on DVD.As a very special bonus extra, this Second Run release also includes director Jim McBride's personal 1969 documentary My Girlfriend's Wedding, where his camera turns on his 'liberated' English girlfriend and her candid conversations about her life and her reasons for marrying another man.Warning:  sections of this film contain strobe light effects.",

As his wife Elisabeth (Glynis Barber) passes her time in charitable work, rehabilitating the district's fallen women, Hyde is drawn into an escalating cycle of lust and murder that seems to know no bounds.Produced by exploitation maestro Harry Alan Towers (The Face of Fu Manchu, Count Dracula) and directed with a hallucinogenic intensity by Gérard Kikoïne (Lady Libertine, Buried Alive), Edge of Sanity plunges the viewer into a labyrinth of depravity from which there is no escape.Product FeaturesBrand new 2K restoration from the original 35mm camera negative by Arrow FilmsHigh Definition Blu-ray (1080p) presentationOriginal uncompressed stereo audioOptional English subtitles for the deaf and hard-of-hearingBrand new audio commentary by writer David Flint and author and filmmaker Sean HoganOver the Edge, a brand new interview with Stephen Thrower, author of Nightmare USAJack, Jekyll and Other Screen Psychos, a brand new interview with Dr Clare Smith, author of Jack the Ripper in Film and CultureFrench Love, a career-spanning interview with director Gérard KikoïneStaying Sane, Gérard Kikoïne discusses Edge of SanityOriginal Theatrical trailerReversible sleeve featuring original and newly commissioned artwork by Graham Humphreys",

In the first half, El Topo journeys across the desert dreamscape with his young son (Brontis Jodorowsky) to duel with four sharp-shooting Zen masters, who each bestow a Great Lesson before they die. In the second half, El Topo becomes the guru of a subterranean tribe of deformed outcasts who he must liberate from depraved cultists in a neighbouring town.A countercultural masterpiece that ingeniously combines iconic Americana symbolism with Jodorowsky's own idiosyncratic surrealist aesthetic, El Topo is an incredible journey through nightmarish violence, mind-bending mysticism and awe-inspiring imagery.

In 1983, entrepreneurial producer and director Charles Band founded Empire International Pictures, which would go on to make some of the most memorable and beloved genre movies of the 1980s. Empire became a mainstay of video stores across the world with their catchy titles, outlandish art, and Band's wholehearted belief in giving audiences a good time.In The Dungeonmaster (AKA Ragewar), computer programmer Paul Bradford is sucked into a fantasy world by Mestema, a demonic sorcerer in search of a worthy opponent. Meanwhile, fresh from the one-two punch of Re-Animator and From Beyond, director Stuart Gordon takes a turn toward fairytale gothic in Dolls, in which a group of strangers find themselves forced to seek shelter at the isolated home of an old toymaker and his wife, only to find that the puppets and dolls have a vicious life of their own. In Cellar Dweller, a comic book artist (Jeffrey Combs) with a penchant for the macabre takes inspiration from an ancient tome and unleashes an ancient evil. Arena presents the ultimate fight night event: man vs monster! In the far future of 4038, a short order cook becomes the first human in fifty years to compete in an intergalactic boxing event on the far side of the universe. Finally in Robot Jox, Stuart Gordon directs Empire Pictures' most ambitious movie yet, as men and women pilot giant machines in gladiatorial battle to settle international disputes over territory.Restored for the digital era with a wealth of extras, these films have never looked better.

The result was a colourful, swashbuckling epic of treachery, heroism and forbidden love: Erik the Conqueror.In 786 AD, the invading Viking forces are repelled from the shores of England, leaving behind a young boy – Erik, son of the slain Viking king. Years later, Erik (George Ardisson, Juliet of the Spirits), raised by the English queen as her own, becomes Duke of Helford, while across the sea, his brother Eron (Cameron Mitchell, Blood and Black Lace) assumes leadership of the Viking horde and sets his sights on conquering England once again, setting the two estranged brothers on a collision course that will determine the fates of their respective kingdoms…Featuring a bombastic score by frequent collaborator Roberto Nicolosi (Black Sunday) and memorably co-starring the stunning Kessler twins (Sodom and Gomorrah), Erik the Conqueror showcases Bava's immense talent for creating awe-inspiring spectacle with limited resources. Now restored in high definition for the first time, Arrow Films is proud to present this cult classic in all its original splendour.SPECIAL EDITION CONTENTS:Brand new 2K restoration of the film from the original camera negativeHigh Definition Blu-ray (1080p) and Standard Definition DVD presentationsOriginal Italian and English mono audio (lossless on the Blu-ray Disc)Newly translated English subtitles for the Italian soundtrackOptional English subtitles for the deaf and hard of hearing for the English soundtrackNew audio commentary by Tim Lucas, author of Mario Bava – All the Colors of the DarkGli imitatori, a comparison between Erik the Conqueror and its unacknowledged source, The VikingsOriginal endingReversible sleeve featuring original and newly commissioned artwork by Graham Humphreys",

    "description": "Andrzej Munk's 'heroic symphony', set during WWII, presents two sardonic tales of courage and valour which aim to demystify the archetypal image of heroism. The first movement focuses on a seemingly feckless and selfish man and his ironic route to finally taking up arms in the national struggle against the Nazis. The second movement is set in a POW camp whose Polish inmates cling to their hopes for an eventual escape, encouraged by the legendary escape of one of their number. Both tales converge to create a blackly comic and perceptive satire; a provocative, powerful, and potent anti-war poem considered amongst the most subversive films of the period.",

Adapting the premise of Woody Allen's The Purple Rose of Cairo to late 1980s Poland, the film centres on a provincial film censor who is horrified to discover that the actors in a trite romantic weepie are refusing to perform their roles. Directed by one of Poland's leading intellectual - and much censored - filmmakers, this multi-awardwinning feature is a key film of the seismic political changes of 1989, and an enthusiastic manifesto for the freedom of the artist - and ultimately, of all humanity.",

His films often focus on family dynamics and recall the films of masters Yasujiro Ozu and Mikio Naruse. Collected here in a limited edition box set are some of his finest works.I Wish tells the story of a family literally separated as elder brother Koichi lives with his mother and grandparents, whilst younger Ryu lives with his deadbeat father. The boys hear a rumour that when two trains on the near completed Kyushu line pass each other a miracle will be granted and they hatch a plan to meet and bring their family back together. Like Father, Like Son finds two families in turmoil as they discover their six year old sons were swapped and they have been raising children who are not biologically their own. Worlds apart in many ways they question their roles and nature vs nurture. After the Storm once again focuses on a separated family; the father, Ryota, a struggling writer clutching at past glory is trying to reconnect with his family following the death of his father, causing him to evaluate his relationship with his son and his own role as a father.Featuring perfectly measured screenplays and astonishing, naturalistic performances, Kore-eda's films are moving portraits of family life that superbly demonstrate the fragility and profundity of familial bonds.SPECIAL EDITION CONTENTS:High Definition transfers of all three filmsOriginal uncompressed PCM stereo and 5.1 DTS-HD MA audio optionsOptional English subtitlesIntroductions by noted critics Tony Rayns and Alexander JacobyFamily Ties – career-spanning interviews with director Hirokazu Kore-eda looking in-depth at all three filmsWhat Would Your Wish Be? – a documentary on I WishInterviews with the Like Father, Like Son castFeature-length documentary on making of After the StormPromotional featurettesMusic video for the main theme of After the Storm directed by Kore-edaMaking-of the Music videoQ&A footage featuring Kore-eda, Kiki Kiriin and Lily FrankieWrap footage from Like Father, Like Son • Select scene commentary by Kore-eda and FrankieI Wish composer Shigeru Kishida and Kore-eda in conversationMusic video for the main theme of I Wish Original trailers, teasers, and TV spotsReversible sleeve featuring two artwork choices",

    "title": "Four Film Noir Classics Blu-ray",
    "price": "£50.00",
    "description": "Arrow FilmsRobert Siodmak / Fritz Lang / Abraham Polonksy / \"Dark urban locales, sultry femme fatales, doomed protagonists and a brooding atmosphere of danger, cynicism and anxiety. These quintessential aspects of film noir are strikingly demonstrated by the four consummate examples of the genre presented in this collection.In The Dark Mirror (1946), directed by Robert Siodmak (The Killers), a man is murdered and there's an obvious suspect, but she has an identical twin sister (both played by Olivia de Havilland, Gone with the Wind), and one of them has a cast-iron alibi. The perfect crime? A psychologist with a specialist interest in twin psychology delves into the heart of the mystery, at considerable risk to himself. In Secret Beyond the Door (1947), Fritz Lang (The Big Heat) adapts the Bluebeard legend with a dash of Daphne du Maurier's Rebecca. Shortly after their marriage, Celia (Joan Bennett, Suspiria) begins to suspect her architect husband Mark (Michael Redgrave, Dead of Night) of having a secret past, and wonders about the reason behind multiple rooms in his self-designed home, one of which is kept permanently locked. In Abraham Polonsky's Force of Evil (1948), an unscrupulous lawyer (John Garfield, The Postman Always Rings Twice) scents a personal fortune when he concocts a plan to merge New York City's numbers rackets into a single powerful and unbreakable operation, but reckons without his brother, who'd rather stay independent. And in Joseph H. Lewis's ultra-stylish The Big Combo (1955), Lieutenant Diamond (Cornel Wilde, The Naked Prey) is determined to bring down mob boss Mr Brown (Richard Conte, Thieves' Highway), even if it means jeopardising his own career. But the feeling is mutual and the unscrupulous gangster is more than willing to operate outside the law to get his man, leading to some wince-inducing set-pieces (some involving a pre-stardom Lee Van Cleef).This collection showcases many of the genre's major names on both sides of the camera. In addition to the directing and acting talent there are cinematographers Stanley Cortez (The Night of the Hunter) and John Alton (An American in Paris), composers Dimitri Tiomkin (High Noon) and Miklós Rósza (The Killers), and writers Nunnally Johnson (The Woman in the Window) and Philip Yordan (Johnny Guitar). It's little wonder that directors such as Martin Scorsese and Quentin Tarantino were so struck by them.Special FeaturesHigh Definition Blu-rayTM (1080p) presentations of four film noir classics: The Dark Mirror, Secret Beyond the Door, Force of Evil and The Big ComboOriginal uncompressed PCM soundtracks on all filmsOptional English subtitles for the deaf and hard of hearing for all filmsCommentaries on all films by leading scholars and critics Adrian Martin (The Dark Mirror), Alan K.

    "price": "£50.00",
    "description": "Arrow VideoTormented protagonists, sadistic villains, sublimated sex and murder most foul. Take a walk through the shadowy streets of Film Noir in these four atmospheric classics.In The Suspect (1944) a genial shopkeeper, Philip Marshall, is constantly nagged by his shrewish wife, Cora, while secretly yearning for a pretty young stenographer. When Cora falls to her death the police are suspicious, and Marshall's neighbour sees a chance for blackmail. A classic noir with an unusual Edwardian setting directed by Robert Siodmak (The Killers), and starring Charles Laughton (The Big Clock), Ella Raines (Phantom Lady) and Henry Daniell (The Body Snatcher). Meanwhile, The Sleeping City (1950) sees an undercover policeman investigating murder and narcotics racketeering at New York's Bellevue Hospital. Starring Richard Conte (Thieves' Highway) and Coleen Gray (Nightmare Alley) this tense, semi-documentary thriller was shot entirely on location by director George Sherman. In Thunder on the Hill (1951) convicted murderer Valerie Carns is being transported for execution when a flood strands her and her guards at a convent hospital, where Sister Mary Bonaventure becomes convinced of Valerie's innocence and sets out to find the real killer. Celebrated director Douglas Sirk is best known for his classic melodramas, but he made a number of noir thrillers and this is one of the best; starring Claudette Colbert (It Happened One Night) and Ann Blyth (Mildred Pierce). Finally, in Six Bridges to Cross (1955) streetwise delinquent Jerry Florea is shot and wounded by rookie policeman Eddie Gallagher while fleeing the scene of a robbery. Despite this, the two develop a friendship as Eddie and his wife take Jerry under their wing, trying to keep him on the straight and narrow. As an adult Jerry marries and seems to settle down, until an armoured security company across the street from him is robbed of two and a half million dollars. Directed by Joseph Pevney (Man of a Thousand Faces) the film stars Tony Curtis (Some Like it Hot), George Nader (Robot Monster), Julie Adams (Creature from the Black Lagoon) and Sal Mineo (Rebel Without a Cause), with cinematography by the great William H. Daniels (The Naked City).This showcase of lesser known noir classics features sterling performances from a host of screen greats, as well as taut direction, stunning cinematography, and superb screenwriting from the likes of Oscar Saul (A Streetcar Named Desire), Jo Eisinger (Gilda, Night and the City), Andrew P. Solt (In a Lonely Place) and Sydney Boehm (When Worlds Collide, The Big Heat).

    "price": "£50.00",
    "description": "Arrow VideoTormented protagonists, sadistic villains, sublimated sex and murder most foul. Take a walk through the shadowy streets of Film Noir in these four atmospheric classics.In The Suspect (1944) a genial shopkeeper, Philip Marshall, is constantly nagged by his shrewish wife, Cora, while secretly yearning for a pretty young stenographer. When Cora falls to her death the police are suspicious, and Marshall's neighbour sees a chance for blackmail. A classic noir with an unusual Edwardian setting directed by Robert Siodmak (The Killers), and starring Charles Laughton (The Big Clock), Ella Raines (Phantom Lady) and Henry Daniell (The Body Snatcher). Meanwhile, The Sleeping City (1950) sees an undercover policeman investigating murder and narcotics racketeering at New York's Bellevue Hospital. Starring Richard Conte (Thieves' Highway) and Coleen Gray (Nightmare Alley) this tense, semi-documentary thriller was shot entirely on location by director George Sherman. In Thunder on the Hill (1951) convicted murderer Valerie Carns is being transported for execution when a flood strands her and her guards at a convent hospital, where Sister Mary Bonaventure becomes convinced of Valerie's innocence and sets out to find the real killer.Celebrated director Douglas Sirk is best known for his classic melodramas, but he made a number of noir thrillers and this is one of the best; starring Claudette Colbert (It Happened One Night) and Ann Blyth (Mildred Pierce). Finally, in Six Bridges to Cross (1955) streetwise delinquent Jerry Florea is shot and wounded by rookie policeman Eddie Gallagher while fleeing the scene of a robbery. Despite this, the two develop a friendship as Eddie and his wife take Jerry under their wing, trying to keep him on the straight and narrow. As an adult Jerry marries and seems to settle down, until an armoured security company across the street from him is robbed of two and a half million dollars. Directed by Joseph Pevney (Man of a Thousand Faces) the film stars Tony Curtis (Some Like it Hot), George Nalder (Robot Monster), Julie Adams (Creature from the Black Lagoon) and Sal Mineo (Rebel Without a Cause), with cinematography by the great William H. Daniels (The Naked City).This showcase of lesser known noir classics features sterling performances from a host of screen greats, as well as taut direction, stunning cinematography, and superb screenwriting from the likes of Oscar Saul (A Streetcar Named Desire), Jo Eisinger (Gilda, Night and the City), Andrew Holt (In a Lonely Place) and Sydney Boehm (The Big Heat).

    "description": "Arrow FilmsFew filmmakers have enjoyed a decade quite so diverse or quite so prolific as Rainer Werner Fassbinder did during the seventies. Amid the likes ofThe Bitter Tears of Petra von KantandFear Eats the Soul, it's easy to forget some of the lesser-known and more singular works, two of which are presented here.Fox and His Friendsis among the director's most personal works and the first to tackle homosexuality in a direct manner. Fassbinder himself plays Fox, a sweet working class soul whose relationship with wealthy industrialist Eugen, he discovers, is based almost wholly on his unexpected lottery win. When his money runs out, so does any affection, with tragic consequences.Chinese Roulette, set in an isolated house during a weekend break, is like Agatha Christie'sAnd Then There Were Nonewithout the murders – a tense psychodrama in which infidelities are revealed and families breakdown. At its centre isnouvelle vagueicon Anna Karina, a rare outsider alongside the familiar Fassbinder faces.",

    "description": "Arrow FilmsIt's clear that Quentin Tarantino is a huge fan: he cast Grier in the title role of his direct homage Jackie Brown, while the one-woman revenge scenario that fuelled the Kill Bill films didn't just come from the Far East.When Foxy Brown's undercover-agent boyfriend is gunned down on the orders of evil drug kingpins, she stops at nothing to exact a thrillingly brutal revenge. This is one of the all-time great blaxploitation films, pulling out all the stops at a time long before anyone thought of inventing political correctness.Pam Grier was given the role of a lifetime as the street-smart yet intensely sexy Foxy, modelling a stupendously varied range of Seventies threads while righteously kicking villainous white butt at every opportunity. She's also given sterling support from Antonio 'Huggy Bear'Fargas as her no-good younger brother and a memorably funky soundtrack.Special FeaturesRestored High Definition Blu-ray presentation (1080p)Optional English SDH subtitles for the deaf and hard of hearingAudio commentary with director Jack HillFrom Black and White to Blaxploitation - Actor Sid Haig speaks about his long and influential friendship with Jack HillA Not So Minor Influence - An Interview with Bob Minor, the first African-American member of the Stuntman's Association, and co-star of Foxy BrownBack to Black - Legendary actors Fred 'The Hammer' Williamson (Black Caesar) and Austin Stoker (Sheba Baby, Assault on Precinct 13), alongside Rosanne Katon (Ebony, Ivory, and Jade) and film scholar Howard S.

    "description": "Arrow FilmsThe late, great Czech filmmaker V ra Chytilová, followed the success of her ground-breaking exercise in anarchic cinema DAISIES (1966) with the even more extraordinary FRUIT OF PARADISE. An experimental, densely symbolic retelling of the Adam and Eve story, Chytilová utilizes every cinematic tool to create a ravishing tapestry of ideas, textures, and visual tropes.Cementing Chytilová s reputation as cine-anarchist, FRUIT OF PARADISE was condemned by the authorities, banned from export and the funds withheld from Chytilová so that she would be powerless to realise her \"vehicles of nihilism\". Unseen for many years outside of its native Czechoslovakia the film is a cornerstone of the Czech New Wave and remains a stunning tour-de-force of colour, technique and formalism.Released for the first time ever in the UK, the FRUIT OF PARADISE is presented from a new HD digital transfer with restored picture and sound, and also includes a new HD restoration of V ra Chytilová s renowned 1961 short film CEILING (Strop) - plus an accompanying Booklet featuring a new essay by author, Czech cinema expert and film programmer Peter Hames\"Chytilová's film is as visually stunning and thrillingly experimental as her previous work DAISIES\" All Movie Guide\"Luridly subversive... impossible to summarize and hard to resist\" Village Voice\"Chytilova's wild, extravagant, and ravishing romp... intoxicating on a sensual level\" Jonathan Rosenbaum, Chicago Reader\"An audacious combination of allegorical narrative and the avant-garde... a brilliantly executed aesthetic exercise.

It is accompanied here by its 1981 sequel Game of Death II (Tower of Death), one final star vehicle for Bruce Lee made using more rare footage found in the studio vaults.Product FeaturesLIMITED EDITION BLU-RAY CONTENTSIllustrated collector's booklet featuring writing on the films by Walter ChawReversible sleeve featuring original and newly commissioned artwork by Tony StellaDISC 1: GAME OF DEATHHigh Definition (1080p) Blu-ray presentations, restored by Arrow Films from original film elements, of the international cut and the Japanese cut of Game of Death via seamless branchingBrand new 2K restoration of the International Cut of Game of Death II by Arrow Films from original film elementsOriginal restored English mono audio on both cutsEnglish subtitles for the deaf and hard-of-hearingFeature commentary by Brandon Bentley & Mike LeederThe Song I'm Singing Tomorrow, an interview with star Colleen CampDeleted and extended scenes from the Chinese-language versions of the film, including two alternate endings (some material in standard-definition)Archive interviews with co-stars Dan Inosanto and Bob WallBehind-the-scenes footage as featured in Bruce Lee: The LegendRare pre-production sales featurette from 1976 with new commentary by Michael Worth and producer Andre MorganFight scene dailies directed by Sammo HungLocations featurette from 2013Trailer gallery, including Bruceploitation and 'Robert Clouse at Golden Harvest' trailer reelsImage galleryDISC 2: GAME OF DEATH IIHigh Definition (1080p) Blu-ray presentation of Game of Death II as well as the Hong Kong Theatrical Cut titled Tower of Death (contains some standard-definition material)Original lossless English mono audio on Game of Death IIOriginal lossless Cantonese, Mandarin and English mono audio on Tower of DeathEnglish subtitles for the deaf and hard-of-hearing on Game of Death, and optional English subtitles on Tower of DeathFeature commentary by Frank Djeng & Michael Worth, co-producers of Enter the Clones of Bruce LeeArchive interview with co-star Roy HoranAlternate Korean version with unique footage, presented in High Definition with original lossless mono audio and English subtitlesAlternate US video version in High Definition with lossless English mono audio, via seamless branchingAlternate end credits sequence for Game of Death IITrailer galleryImage gallery",

BUT IT WILL TAKE A MIRACLE TO MAKE THEM A FAMILY.Adapted from the novel Don t Look and It Won t Hurt by Richard Peck, Allison Anders (Grace of My Heart) whipped up a storm at the 42nd Berlin International Film Festival with her masterfully crafted tale of a young woman trying to find love while struggling to bring up her two daughters.Abandoned by her husband, Nora (Brooke Adams, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, The Stuff) waitresses to keep her head above water while raising two teenagers in a small New Mexico town trailer park. Beautiful and rebellious, Trudi (Ione Skye, Wayne s World, Zodiac) quits school to work alongside her mother, while her sister Shade (Fairuza Balk, The Craft, American History X) whittles away her time watching old movie matinees. Their life is turned on its head when Trudi finds that she has fallen pregnant after a string of promiscuous relationships and the girls' absent father returns with hopes of mending the relationships he broke when he left.A wonderfully engaging story of the woes of teenagers reaching adulthood, Gas Food Lodging is a distinctly American portrayal of a mother trying to raise two wayward teens with growing pains, who are learning about love, life and each other. This director-approved restoration finally affords this 90s modern classic the home video treatment it rightly deserves.DIRECTOR-APPROVED SPECIAL EDITION CONTENTS:High Definition Blu-ray (1080p) presentation, approved by director Allison AndersOriginal uncompressed 2.0 audioOptional English subtitles for the deaf and hard of hearingThe Road to Laramie: A Look Back at Gas Food Lodging - a brand new interview with Allison Anders and Josh OlsonCinefile: Reel Women (Chris Rodley, 1995), a documentary looking at the challenges women face in the film industry from independent to studio filmmaking, featuring interviews with Allison Anders, Kathryn Bigelow, Jane Campion, Penny Marshall, Gale Anne Hurd and othersReversible sleeve featuring original and newly commissioned artwork by Matthew Griffin",

His only problem is that his wife is suffering from amnesia, and her past is unknown. Things begin to fall apart, however, when both his parents die suddenly, killed by a mysterious stranger with Yukio's face. Only when Yukio confronts this stranger will the mystery of his identity, and his wife's past, be revealed.Adapting the Edogawa Rampo short story The Twins, Shinya Tsukamoto's (Tetsuo I & II) modernist Meiji horror represents the director's first foray into period films and fleshes out Rampo's original tale of savage sibling rivalry considerably.Marked out by its bold, hyper-realistic colour palate, exaggerated make up and costume design and an absurd taste of the carnivalesque, this chilling psychological tale should prove more than a sufficient antidote to those left jaded by the restrained, by-numbers approach adopted by the majority of late 1990s horrors that appeared in the wake of Ring.Special FeaturesNew HD transfer / Audio commentary by Tom Mes, author of Iron Man: The Cinema of Shinya TsukamotoMaking of Gemini\" featurette directed by Takashi Miike (15 minutes)Venice Film Festival featurette (17 minutes)Make-up demonstration featurette (6 minutes)Behind the Scenes (20 minutes)Original Trailer",

A great satire of Japanese society and popular cinema, Getting Any?, embraces the spirit of Kitano s early stand-up and television work and as such it offers a genuine inside look into his true personality.The story follows the nerdy middle age Asao, a professional daydreamer, whose one and only goal in life is - as the title suggests - to get laid. Asao embarks on a series of slapstick adventures in search of fulfilling his ultimate fantasy - making wild passionate sex with a woman. His holy quest for sex lands Asao in a series of absurd situations, involving robbery schemes, big movie productions, yakuza gang rivalry wars and scientific experiments.Getting Any? may be very episodic and perhaps even pointless in the grand scheme of things, but for those willing to go for it, it's a hoot from start to finish.Special Features:Brand new restoration",

    "description": "Arrow FilmsWhile the release of Dario Argento's The Bird with the Crystal Plumage gave rise to a glut of imitators, there was more to the giallo than just shameless copycats setting out to ape a rigid formula. This volume of Giallo Essentials celebrates the range and breadth of the genre with three lesser-seen films from its early 1970s heyday.In Silvio Amadio's Smile Before Death, familicide with a sprinkling of Oedipal love is the order of the day when teenager Nancy (Jenny Tamburi, The Suspicious Death of a Minor) returns home to discover the apparent suicide of her mother, and quickly comes to suspect that her stepfather (Silvano Tranquilli, The Bloodstained Butterfly) and his mistress (Rosalba Neri, The French Sex Murders) are to blame.Next, Horny priests and self-flagellating nuns abound in Francesco Mazzei's The Weapon, the Hour, the Motive, as police commissioner Franco Boito (Renzo Montagnani, Massacre in Rome) investigates the brutal murder of a young clergyman, only to enter into an affair with the dead man's lover (Bedy Moratti, Calling All Police Cars). Finally, in Giuseppe Bennati's The Killer Reserved Nine Seats, an assortment of wealthy degenerates - including Italian cult mainstays Andrea Scotti (Django, Prepare a Coffin) and Howard Ross (The Pyjama Girl Case) - answer the summons of an eccentric nobleman (Chris Avram, A Bay of Blood) and assemble in the theatre attached to his ancestral home, only to find themselves trapped in the decaying building while a savage killer picks them off Agatha Christie-style!With gory murders, wanton debauchery and left-field plot twists a-plenty, all three of these oft-overlooked gialli are restored in 2K from their original camera negatives - including brand-new, Arrow-exclusive restorations of Smile Before Death and The Weapon, the Hour, the Motive - alongside a range of in-depth bonus features.Product FeaturesBrand new 2K restorations from the original camera negatives of Smile Before Death and The Weapon, the Hour, the Motive2K restoration from the original camera negative of The Killer Reserved Nine SeatsHigh Definition Blu-ray (1080p) presentations of each filmOriginal lossless mono Italian and English soundtracks on Smile Before Death and The Killer Reserved Nine SeatsOriginal lossless mono Italian soundtrack on The Weapon, the Hour, the MotiveEnglish subtitles for the Italian soundtracksOptional English subtitles for the deaf and hard of hearing for the English soundtracksRigid box packaging with original poster artwork in a windowed Giallo Essentials Collection slipcoverReversible sleeves for each film featuring original and newly commissioned artwork by Adam Rabalais, Peter Strain and Haunt LoveDisc One: Smile Before DeathBrand new audio commentary by authors and critics Troy Howarth and Nathaniel ThompsonOriginal Italian and English front and end titlesSmile of the Hyena, a brand new video interview with Stefano Amadio, film journalist and son of director Silvio AmadioNever-before-seen extended nude scenes, not used in the final filmImage galleryDisc Two: The Weapon, The Hour, The MotiveBrand new audio commentary by author and critic Alexandra Heller-NicholasA Man in Giallo, a brand new video interview with actor Salvatore PuntilloFront and end titles for the lost English-language dubImage galleryDisc Three: The Killer Reserved Nine SeatsBrand new audio commentary by author and critic Kat EllingerHanging with Howard, a video interview with actor Howard RossWriting with Biagio, a video interview with screenwriter Biagio ProiettiItalian theatrical trailer (in Italian and English)Image galleryFirst Pressing Only:Individual illustrated collector's booklets for each film, featuring new writing by Rachael Nisbet, Barry Forshaw and Peter Jilmstad",

    "description": "Arrow VideoAt the height of the Italian giallo boom of the early 1970s, scores of filmmakers turned their hand to crafting their own unique takes on these lurid murder-mysteries. This volume of Giallo Essentials presents three distinctly different but equally thrilling examples of genre, featuring some of European cult cinema's most recognizable faces.In The Night Evelyn Came Out of the Grave, director Emilio P. Miraglia (The Red Queen Kills Seven Times) melds the giallo's trademark twisty whodunit storytelling with gothic chills, as troubled aristocrat Alan Cunningham (Anthony Steffen, Django the Bastard) is haunted by the specter of his dead wife Evelyn, and the gruesome and untimely deaths of several members of his family. Next, Riccardo Freda's (Double Face) The Iguana with the Tongue of Fire finds tough ex-cop John Norton (Luigi Pistilli, A Bay of Blood) drafted in to catch the acid-throwing, razor-wielding maniac who's terrorizing the streets of Dublin. Finally, Sergio Martino's (Torso) The Suspicious Death of a Minor melds giallo trappings with elements of the then flourishing poliziotteschi crime thrillers, as undercover cop Paolo Germi (Claudio Cassinelli, What Have They Done to Your Daughters?) hunts a Milanese criminal outfit following the brutal murder of a teenage prostitute.Brutal violence, globe-trotting intrigue and abundant sleaze collide in these three quintessential gialli, each one fully restored from its original camera negative and presented alongside an array of incisive bonus features.Product Features2K restorations from the original camera negative for all three filmsHigh Definition Blu-ray (1080p) presentations of each filmOriginal Italian and English front and end titlesOriginal lossless mono Italian and English soundtracksOptional English subtitles for the Italian soundtracksOptional English subtitles for the deaf and hard of hearing for the English soundtracksRigid box packaging with original poster artwork in a windowed Giallo Essentials Collection slipcoverReversible sleeves for each film featuring original and newly commissioned artwork by Gilles Vranckx, Graham Humphreys and Chris MalbonDisc one: The night Evelyn came out of the graveAudio commentary by Troy HowarthExclusive introduction by Erika BlancInterview with critic Stephen ThrowerThe Night Erika Came Out of the Grave - exclusive interview with Erika BlancThe Whip and the Body - archival interview with Erika BlancStill Rising from the Grave - archival interview with production designer Lorenzo BaraldiOriginal Italian theatrical trailerDisc two: The iguana with the tongue of fireAudio commentary by giallo connoisseurs Adrian J.

    "description": "Arrow FilmsGiants and Toys is a sharp and snappy corporate satire revolving around the ruthless machinations of a group of admen working in the confectionary industry.As a new recruit to the marketing department of World Caramel, fresh-faced graduate Nishi (Hiroshi Kawaguchi) is eager to impress his ambitious and hard-nosed boss Goda (Black Test Car's Hideo Takamatsu), even if it strains his relationships with his college friend Yokoyama (Koichi Fujiyama) and budding love interest Masami (Michiko Ono), who work at the rival companies of Giant and Apollo. With World's lead over its competitors slipping badly, the two spot a chance to get back in the race in the shape of the pretty but unsophisticated 18-year-old, Kyoko (Hitomi Nozoe). Goda and Nishi get to work polishing this rough diamond as their new campaign girl, but as the three rival confectionary companies pitch themselves into an all-out advertising war that spills out onto the streets of Tokyo as it escalates to ludicrous extremes, Kyoko's newfound fame starts going to her head.Making its worldwide Blu-ray debut, this lurid adaptation of the award-winning 1957 novel by Ken Kaiko is considered a landmark in Japanese film history and a key work by Yasuzo Masumura (Blind Beast, Red Angel), one of the country's most highly acclaimed directors of his generation. Its absurdist and acidly cynical take on the excesses of the media and advertising worlds recalls the work of Frank Tashlin (Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?), as it presents a garish vision of a bold new postwar Japan where traditional company values come head-to-head with American-style consumer capitalism.Special FeaturesHigh Definition Blu-ray (1080p) presentationOriginal uncompressed Japanese mono audioOptional English subtitlesBrand new audio commentary by Japanese cinema scholar Irene González-LópezNewly filmed introduction by Japanese cinema expert Tony RaynsIn the Realm of the Publicists, a brand new visual essay by Asian cinema scholar Earl JacksonOriginal TrailerImage GalleryReversible sleeve featuring original and newly commissioned artwork by Tony Stella",

Set in the suburbs of Naples, focusing on organized crime and the relationships between gangsters, drug dealers, and ordinary people, Gomorrah depicts street-level crime and its hierarchical organization from the pavement, all the way up to regional government offices.The Savastano clan, led by the Godfather, Pietro (Fortunato Cerlino) and his loyal wife, Lady Imma (Maria Pia Calzone) reign over Naples with the assistance of his obedient and self-confident right-hand man, Ciro 'The Immortal' (Marco D'Amore), who must teach their only son Gennaro - the heir to the Savastano gilded throne, the brutal and bloody ways of their clan.As Gennaro transforms into, and beyond, what Ciro and Pietro could have ever wished for him to become, power struggles ensue, and the balance of power shifts back and forth with devastating consequences for all involved. As the era of the Savastano clan looks to be crumbling, Ciro and Gennaro's fates will intertwine as they spread their criminal links beyond their homeland, encountering new illicit ways to trade in drugs and thrive on the spoils, despite both of them being all but destroyed in the process.",

    "title": "Gothic Fantastico | Four Italian Tales Of Terror | Limited Edition Blu-ray",
    "price": "£60.00",
    "description": "Arrow FilmsWhile groundbreaking director Mario Bava (Black Sunday, Black Sabbath) remains the most well-known purveyor of Italian Gothic horror, many other filmmakers tried their hand at the form throughout the 1960s as part of a hugely prolific and popular cycle. Gothic Fantastico presents four off-the-beaten path titles from this classic period, all of which demonstrate Italy's ability to expand genre beyond the classic literary monsters that dominated elsewhere.Gaslighting abounds in Massimo Pupillo's Lady Morgan's Vengeance - a delicate tale of romance and mystery, with a sprinkling of sadism and the supernatural - as newlywed Sir Harold Morgan (Paul Muller, Nightmare Castle) attempts to destroy his new bride (Barbara Nelli, Double Face) with help from his sinister maid (Erika Blanc, Kill, Baby... Kill!). Meanwhile, the perverse influence of Poe is used to great effect in Alberto De Martino's The Blancheville Monster - a tale of family curses and madmen in the attic, as Emilie de Blancheville (Ombretta Colli, Gladiator of Rome) returns home to her brother Roderic (Gérard Tichy, Hatchet for the Honeymoon) and discovers her own family may be out for her blood. Mino Guerinni's The Third Eye features not only a very early role for Italian cult film icon Franco Nero, but a plot that borrows several elements from Hitchcock, layered with a whiff of necrophilia. Finally, Damiano Damiani's The Witch takes a more avant-garde approach, when a young historian (Richard Johnson, Zombie Flesh Eaters) is lured to work for an ageing woman, only to be held captive when he becomes obsessed with her beautiful daughter (Rosanna Schiaffino, The Killer Reserved Nine Seats).Madness, obsession and messed up families are the order of the day in these four lesser-known monochrome gems from Italy's peak Gothic period, now fully restored in 2K from their original camera negatives for the first time and presented alongside an array of in-depth extras.Product FeaturesBrand new 2K restorations from the original camera negatives of all four filmsHigh Definition Blu-rayTM(1080p) presentations of each filmOriginal Italian and English front and end titles on The Blancheville Monster, The Third Eye and The WitchOriginal lossless mono Italian soundtracks on all four filmsOriginal lossless mono English soundtracks on The Blancheville Monster, The Third Eye and The WitchOptional English subtitles for the Italian soundtracksOptional English subtitles for the deaf and hard of hearing for the English soundtracksBrand new video introductions to each film by Italian film devotee Mark Thompson AshworthImage galleriesLimited edition 80-page book featuring new writing on the films by Roberto Curti, Rob Talbot, Jerome Reuter, Rod Barnett and Kimberly LindbergsFold-out double-sided posterLimited edition packaging with reversible sleeves featuring original and newly commissioned artwork by Colin MurdochDISC ONE: LADY MORGAN'S VENGEANCEBrand new audio commentary by author and critic Alexandra Heller-NicholasBrand new video essay on the film by author and producer Kat EllingerBrand new video interview with actress Erika BlancNewly edited video interview with actor Paul MullerNewly edited audio interview with director Massimo PupilloThe complete original cineromanzo, published in Suspense in April 1971TrailerDISC TWO: THE BLANCHEVILLE MONSTERBrand new audio commentary by filmmaker and film historian Paul Anthony NelsonBrand new video essay on the film by writer and pop culture historian Keith AllisonBrand new video interview with author and filmmaker Antonio TentoriOpening credits for the US release of the filmTrailerDISC THREE: THE THIRD EYEBrand new audio commentary by author and critic Rachael NisbetBrand new video essay on the film by author and filmmaker Lindsay HallamNewly edited video interview with actress Erika BlancDISC FOUR: THE WITCHBrand new audio commentary by author and producer Kat EllingerBrand new video essay on the film by author and academic Miranda CorcoranBrand new video interview with author and filmmaker Antonio Tentori",

    "description": "Arrow FilmsTwo peerless masters of Japanese cinema – Kinji Fukasaku (Battles without Honor and Humanity, Battle Royale) and Takashi Miike (Dead or Alive, Audition) – present their own distinctive adaptations of yakuza expert Goro Fujita's gangster novel Graveyard of Honor, each tapping into the zeitgeist of a distinct period of Japanese history.Set during the turbulent post-war years, Fukasaku's original 1975 film charts the rise and fall of real-life gangster Rikio Ishikawa (Tetsuya Watari, Outlaw Gangster VIP). Shot through with the same stark realism and quasidocumentarian approach as Fukasaku's earlier Battles Without Honor and Humanity, Fukasaku nonetheless breaks new ground through his portrayal of a gangster utterly without honor or ethics, surviving by any means necessary in a world of brutal criminality.Meanwhile, Miike's 2002 retelling transplants the story to Tokyo at the turn of the millennium. Less a direct remake of Fukasaku's film than a radical reimagining of the same overarching premise, Miike's film captures both the hedonism and nihilism of the modern Japanese crime scene in deliriously stylish fashion, resulting in a fascinating companion piece to the original that nonetheless stands as its own entity.Arrow Films is proud to present these two intertwined but unique crime thrillers from two celebrated filmmakers at the peak of their creative powers.Special Features:Two-disc set featuring two different versions of Graveyard of Honor, the 1975 film by Kinji Fukasaku and the 2002 film by Takashi MiikeSpecial edition packaging featuring newly commissioned artwork by Ian MacEwanReversible sleeves featuring original and newly commissioned artwork by Ian MacEwanDISC ONE – GRAVEYARD OF HONOR (1975)High Definition Blu-ray™ (1080p) presentationOriginal lossless Japanese PCM 1.0 mono soundtrackOptional English subtitlesAudio commentary by author and critic Mark SchillingLike a Balloon: The Life of a Yakuza, a visual essay by critic and Projection Booth podcast host Mike WhiteA Portrait of Rage, an archival appreciation of Fukasaku and his films, featuring interviews with filmmakers, scholars, and friends of the directorOn the Set with Fukasaku, an archival interview with assistant director Kenichi OguriTheatrical trailerImagery galleryDISC TWO – GRAVEYARD OF HONOR (2002)High Definition Blu-ray™ (1080p) presentationOriginal lossless Japanese PCM 2.0 stereo soundtrackOptional English subtitlesAudio commentary by Miike biographer Tom MesMen of Violence: The Male Driving Forces in Takashi Miike's Cinema, a visual essay by author and critic Kat EllingerArchival \"interview special\" featuring Miike and cast members Goro Kishitani and Narimi ArimoriArchival \"making-of\" featuretteArchival \"making-of\" teaserArchival press release interviews featuring Miike, Kishitani and ArimoriArchival \"premiere special\" featuring Miike, Kishitani and ArimoriTheatrical trailerImagery gallery",

    "description": "Arrow FilmsDebut filmmaker Lukas Feigelfeld has crafted one of the most celebrated horror debuts in recent years. Playing prestigious festivals worldwide, it is one of the most original takes on the subject of witchcraft which echoes Robert Eggers' The Witch but draws on broader influences including the creeping dread and hallucinogenic imagery of David Lynch and Panos Cosmatos.In an isolated alpine hut at the turn of the 15th century Albrun is a young girl growing up alone. As an adult, she is a single mother and a marked woman, outcast by a society twisted in deep-rooted superstitions and misogyny. Still haunted by the death of her own mother and increasingly abused by the community around her, Albrun starts to defy the role she has been dealt in life and embarks on a path of self-empowerment – the price of which may be an even greater darkness than she has ever known before.Described as \"a spellbinding audiovisual symphony\" (The Hollywood Reporter) and ranked third in Rotten Tomatoes' \"Best Horror Movies of 2019\", Hagazussa: A Heathen's Curse is a journey into the madness prevalent both in our minds and in the world around us, and into whether the difference between the two is always as clear as we hope for it to be.Special Edition ContentsHigh Definition Blu-ray™ (1080p) presentationOriginal DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 surround and LPCM Stereo 2.0 AudioOptional English subtitlesAudio commentary by critic and author Kat EllingerSelect-scene audio commentary by writer-director Lukas FeigelfeldBeton [Concrete] (2013, 55 mins), a short film by Lukas FeigelfeldDeleted scene with optional commentary by FeigelfeldMMMD music videoTheatrical trailerTeaserReversible sleeve featuring artwork by Adrian Baxter",

Despite not much time left, for what was supposed to be his final film he adapted Kazuo Dan s 1937 novella HANAGATAMI, his passion project 40 years in the making.In the spring of 1941, sixteen-year-old Toshihiko leaves Amsterdam to attend school in Karatsu, a small town on the western coast of Japan, where his aunt Keiko cares for his ailing cousin Mina. Immersed in the seaside s nature and culture, Toshihiko soon befriends the town s other extraordinary adolescents as they all contend with the war s inescapable gravitational pull. With his memories as a survivor of World War II echoing in the uncertainty of world events unfolding today, director Obayashi returns us to 1941, a pivotal time for Japan, as the unstoppable momentum of war forcibly seized the lives of youth away to battlefields where they disappeared forever. In dazzling, full-bloom Obayashi style, Hanagatami captures the passion, innocence, and struggle of the end days of youth in a country consumed by the flames of war.Special FeaturesMaking OfInterview with Nobuhiko ObayashiTrailer",

Following a ferocious bust-up, Richard tries to make amends in the form of a sailing trip on his family yacht. After all, a friendship is the kind of ship that never sinks – until the yacht breaks down and the trio are left stranded in the middle of the ocean. As food and water supplies start to sink and rivalries, dark secrets and sexual tension start to surface, the question becomes: which of these three broken humans will run out of air first?Dubbed a \"twisty little thriller\" (Eye For Film) that \"will appeal to horror lovers everywhere\" (Love Horror), Harpoon is Edgar Allan Poe by way of Seinfeld and an exercise in brilliant pacing, direction and acting.

Picking up immediately after the events of the original Hellraiser, Hellbound: Hellraiser II finds Kirsty detained at a psychiatric institute and under the care of Dr. Channard, a man with an unhealthy interest in the occult.

However, despite huge expectations, major studio backing and an unlimited budget, after three weeks the production collapsed under the weight of arguments, technical complications and illness.In this compelling, award-winning documentary Serge Bromberg and Ruxandra Medrea present Inferno's incredible expressionistic original rushes, screen tests, and on-location footage, whilst also reconstructing Clouzot's original vision, and shedding light on the ill-fated endeavour through interviews, dramatisations of unfilmed scenes, and Clouzot's own notes.Special FeaturesHigh Definition Blu-ray (1080p) presentationOriginal 5.1 DTS-HD Master AudioOptional English subtitlesLucy Mazdon on Henri-Georges Clouzot, the French cinema expert and academic talks at length about the films of Clouzot and the troubled production of InfernoThey Saw Inferno, a featurette including unseen material, providing further insight into the production of InfernoFilmed Introduction by Serge BrombergInterview with Serge BrombergStills galleryOriginal trailerReversible sleeve featuring original and newly commissioned artwork by Twins of Evil",

    "price": "£25.00",
    "description": "Arrow VideoWidely heralded as one of the greatest serial killer movies of all time, Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer presents a bleak and unflinching dive into the mind of a mass murderer.Recently released from prison, the nomadic Henry (Michael Rooker, Guardians of the Galaxy, The Walking Dead) finds temporary abode in the rundown Chicago lodgings of a former jail acquaintance and small-time drug dealer, Otis (Tom Towles). Hiding behind his unremarkable employment as a pest exterminator, Henry leads a double life, prowling the streets by night on a brutal and apparently motiveless killing spree. As the bodies mount up, Otis finds himself inducted into Henry’s dark secret world, but when Otis’ sister Becky (Tracy Arnold) moves in, herself fleeing from an uncomfortable domestic situation, it quickly becomes apparent that two’s company, but three’s a crowd.Based on the horrific true-life crimes of Henry Lee Lucas, the harrowing controversial debut feature from John McNaughton (Mad Dog and Glory, Wild Things) returns to the UK in its best-looking release ever, in a new 4K restoration supervised by the director himself.Limited Edition Contents (Blu-ray):Brand new 4K restoration from the original camera negatives, approved by John McNaughtonHigh Definition Blu-ray (1080p) presentationOriginal 2.0 stereo mix and 5.1 DTS-HD Master audioEnglish subtitles for the deaf and hard of hearingReversible sleeve featuring original and newly commissioned artwork by Eric Adrian LeeLimited edition 60-page booklet featuring new writing by Shaun Kimber, Peter Vronsky, Alexandra Heller-Nicholas and Julian PetleyBooklet containing the original storyboards for Henry: Portrait of a Serial KillerDouble-sided fold-out posterSix collector’s postcards (Limited Edition exclusive)Disc One - Features & Extras:Brand new 4K restoration from the original camera negativesHigh Definition Blu-ray™ (1080p) presentationBrand new audio commentary by John McNaughton & Steven A.

SEVEN WOMEN WILL TRY.Starring legendary actors Oliver Reed (Gladiator, The Brood) and George Kennedy (The Delta Force and The Naked Gun series), Hired to Kill is an essential slice of '90s action fare featuring guns, girls and a plethora of budget-busting explosions for good measure.Action movie staple Brian Thompson (whose brief turn in 1984's The Terminator led to a starring role in the 1986 Sylvester Stallone vehicle Cobra) stars as Frank Ryan, a mercenary sent to track down a rebel leader in hostile territory. Posing as a fashion designer, he won't be going it alone, as he'll be aided by seven beautiful – but deadly – female fighters.Whilst the opportunity to see Oliver Reed chewing up the scenery behind an elaborate moustache merits the price of the admission alone, Hired to Kill is also noteworthy as being co-directed by Nico Mastorakis – the man behind such cult favourites as Island of Death and The Zero Boys.DIRECTOR-APPROVED SPECIAL EDITION CONTENTSBrand new 2K restoration of the film, approved by writer-director Nico MastorakisHigh Definition Blu-ray (1080p) and Standard Definition DVD presentationsOriginal Stereo audio (uncompressed PCM on the Blu-ray)Optional English subtitles for the deaf and hard of hearingAudio Commentary with editor Barry ZetlinHired to Direct – a brand new interview with director Nico Mastorakis on the making of Hired to KillUndercover Mercenary – a brand new interview with star Brian ThompsonOriginal Theatrical TrailerStills GalleryOriginal Freedom or Death Screenplay (BD/DVD-ROM Content)Reversible sleeve featuring original and newly commissioned artwork by Graham Humphreys",

    "description": "Arrow FilmsHiroshima (1953) is a powerful evocation of the devastation wrought by the world's first deployment of the atomic bomb and its aftermath, based on the written eye-witness accounts of its child survivors compiled by Dr. Arata Osada for the 1951 book Children Of The A Bomb: Testament Of The Boys And Girls Of Hiroshima.Adapted for the screen by independent director Hideo Sekigawa (Listen to the Voices of the Sea, Tokyo Untouchable) and screenwriter Yasutaro Yagi (Theatre of Life, Rice), Hiroshima combines a harrowing documentary realism with moving human drama, in a tale of the suffering, endurance and survival of a group of teachers, their students and their families. It boasts a rousing score composed by Akira Ifukube (Godzilla) and an all-star cast including Yumeji Tsukioka (Late Spring, The Eternal Breasts), Isuzu Yamada (Throne of Blood, Yojimbo) and Eiji Okada (Hiroshima Mon Amour, Woman in the Dunes), appearing alongside an estimated 90,000 residents from the city as extras, including many survivors from that fateful day on 6th August 1945.Hiroshima was produced and distributed outside of the studio system by the Japan Teachers' Union following the mixed critical reception to Children of Hiroshima (1952), directed by Kaneto Shindo the previous year, the first dramatic feature to deal directly with the atomic bombing. Although sequences from the film were used in Alain Resnais' classic of French New Wave cinema, Hiroshima Mon Amour (1959), it has been effectively out of circulation in Japan and the rest of the world since its original release in 1953 due to the force and political sensitivity of its message.

Faced with a waiting period of eight years, George is encouraged by his former dancing partner Anita (Pauline Goddard, Modern Times) to marry an American girl and desert her once safely across the border. He successfully targets visiting school teacher Emmy Brown (Olivia de Havilland, Gone with the Wind), but his plan is compromised by a pursuing immigration officer, and blossoming feelings of genuine love for Emmy.A moving and thoughtful film with a wonderful script (co-written by Billy Wilder), Hold back the Dawn benefits from evocative performances by Boyer and de Havilland, and an over-arching sense of romantic melancholy. An enduring classic of its era, Leisen s film was nominated for no-less than six Academy Awards and is presented here in High Definition for the first time.",

Hirosuke eases his way into the nobleman s household and his dead double s marital bed. But as long-repressed memories begin to bubble to the surface, he soon finds himself drawn to a remote isle where he is confronted by a mad scientist and his malformed men, and discovers the key that will unlock some long-suppressed mysteries of his own.A dark labyrinth of the monstrous and perverse that fuses mystery and horror while incorporating motifs from a myriad of Rampo's tales, Horrors of Malformed Men boasts astonishing carnivalesque art design and haunting performances. Withdrawn from cinemas by its own studio after its original scandalous release nearly fifty years ago, the film is among the very best screen interpretations of the author s macabre brand of horror-fantasy fiction, and a unique oddity of Japanese cult cinema.Special FeaturesBrand new 2K restoration of the film from the original negativeHigh Definition (1080p) Blu-ray presentationUncompressed mono 1.0 PCM audioNewly translated optional English subtitlesTwo audio commentaries by Japanese cinema experts Tom Mes and Mark SchillingMalformed Movies: a new video interview with Toei exploitation movie screenwriter Masahiro KakefudaMalformed Memories: Filmmakers Shinya Tsukamoto (Tetsuo the Iron Man) and Minoru Kawasaki (The Calamari Wrestler) on the career of director Teruo IshiiIshii in Italia: Ishii and Mark Schilling visit the Far East Film FestivalImage GalleryTheatrical trailerReversible sleeve featuring original and newly commissioned artwork by Dan Mumford",

    "description": "Arrow FilmsThe American artist Kevin Jerome Everson has created a remarkable body of moving image work that co-exists within film and art exhibition contexts. With a sense of place and history, his films, shot primarily on 16mm, combine scripted and documentary moments with touches of formalism. The focus is on craft and duration, and the gestures and tasks caused by certain physical and socio-economic conditions in the lives, labour and leisure of working-class Black Americans and people of African descent. They suggest not only the relentlessness of everyday life but also reveal its inherent beauty.This selection of four features and 17 short films, together with an 'image booklet' of photographs, has been specifically curated by the artist. Second Run are proud to present the first comprehensive collection to be released on Blu-ray of Everson's award-winning and critically acclaimed films.This Special Edition 2-disc Blu-ray Set includes the following films:Disc 1Special FeaturesSpicebush (2005)The Island of St. Matthews (2013)Tonsler Park (2017)Shorts:Fe26 (2014)Sound That (2014)Ears, Nose and Throat (2016)Disc 2Feature:Erie (2010)Shorts:Old Cat (2009)Company Line (2009)BZV (2010)Ten Five in the Grass (2012)Grand Finale (2015)Three Quarters (2015)Eason (2016)IFO (2017)Rams 23 Blue Bears 21 (2017)Polly One (2018)Round Seven (2018)Union (2019)Sanfield, (2020)Brown Thrasher (2020)BLU-RAY 2-DISC SPECIAL EDITION CONTENTSPresented from new digital transfers from original materials, approved by the director.BookletOriginal soundtracks in stereo 24-bit LPCM audioWorld Premiere on Blu-ray",

A love story set against the rural backdrop of communist farming collectives, a young girl (the great Mari Törőcsik in her film debut) falls for farm worker Máté, but is betrothed by her domineering father to another man.This pastoral take on Romeo and Juliet is a rich and achingly beautiful work, framed by the turbulent changes in society taking place at that time.Voted by international critics as one of the '10 Best Hungarian Films of All Time'\"The heroine of Zoltán Fábri's marvellous film should have the prize for the Best Actress...

He thinks science will provide the answers, but ultimately learns far more about himself through experiencing love, betrayal, loss, and facing his own mortality.As much a philosophical essay as a narrative feature Illumination is a cinematic mosaic combining art and science, intellect and emotion. Innovatively structured, this unflinching examination of one man's life became an iconic cultural marker for a whole generation.The DVD is presented in a superb new director-approved HD transfer with restored picture and sound and features Marcin Latallo's acclaimed 1996 short film A Trace (Slad) about his father, the lead actor in Illumination, Stanislaw Latallo.Special Features:New Filmed Interview with Director Krzysztof ZanussiShort film A Trace (Slad)Booklet essay",

The result is In The Aftermath, a haunting post-apocalyptic vision like no other.In a radiation-soaked wasteland, two surviving soldiers, Frank and Goose, search for essential supplies amid the rubble. After a violent confrontation, Frank is haunted by visions of an angelic young girl holding a giant egg, herself a refugee from another world altogether. Could the egg be the key to saving both their worlds?A unique mash-up of 1980s B-movie nuclear paranoia and hauntingly lyrical animation, In The Aftermath is presented in a stunning new restoration that highlights Oshii's visionary genius and Colpaert's low-budget ingenuity.Special FeaturesBrand new 2K restoration from original film elements, exclusively restored by Arrow FilmsPresented on High Definition Blu-ray (1080p)Original uncompressed stereo PCM audioOptional English subtitles for the deaf and hard-of-hearingThe Path To Aftermath, a newly filmed interview with producer Tom DuganApocalypse Then, a newly filmed interview with star Tony MarkesBefore The Aftermath: The Influence of Angel's Egg, a new appreciation of Mamoru Oshii's original film by anime expert Andrew Osmond (author of Arrow Books' Ghost In The Shell)Still and poster galleryReversible sleeve featuring original and newly commissioned artwork by Corey Brickley",

Alain (Alain Chabat, Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets) and Marie (Léa Drucker, War of the Worlds) are a middle-aged bourgeois couple who move to their new house in a quiet suburb. A key feature of their new abode that the estate agent points out to them is a mysterious tunnel in the basement.

    "description": "Arrow FilmsExploitation legend Teruo Ishii (Horrors of Malformed Men, Orgies of Edo) delivers one of his most extreme visions of violent eroticism in this, the sixth in his abnormal love series. Tattoos and torture await women forced into servitude in Ishii's Inferno of Torture.Unable to repay a local lender, Yumi (Yumika Katayama) takes up an offer to serve as a geisha for two years with a promise of freedom once her debt is repaid. She quickly realises that this is less a house of geishas than an extremely cruel brothel specialising in supplying western visitors with tattooed playthings. Taken under the wing of one of the leading tattoo artists vying for a coveted spot in the Shogun's good graces through his work, Yumi's body becomes a battleground as a rival artist becomes determined not to lose his spot at the top. When the madam, Otatsu (Mieko Fujimoto) trains her eye on the blossoming relationship between the benevolent artist Horihide (Teruo Yoshida) and his model, she makes sure than her stay is less than hospitable, inspiring the torturous inferno of the title.Following Ishii's legendary Shogun's Joy of Torture and Orgies of Edo, the prolific filmmaker still manages to turn up the heat in this incredibly violent and salacious entry in a filmography unlike any other. From the film's opening scene depicting some of the most perverse violence ever captured on screen, through to the shock ending that will leave the audience's mouths agape, there's nothing quite like Inferno of Torture. Tender romance clashes with vile sadism as a sea of tattooed female flesh floods nearly every frame of this film depicting Japan's Edo period as only Ishii could.Special FeaturesHigh Definition Blu-ray (1080p) presentationOriginal uncompressed mono audioOptional English subtitlesAudio Commentary by Japanese cinema expert Tom MesErotic Grotesque Nonsense & the Foundations of Japan's Cult Counterculture - a condensed version of Jasper Sharp's Miskatonic Institute lectureTrailerReversible sleeve featuring original and newly-commissioned artwork by Jacob Phillips",

The rebellion the film depicts is social and moral, not political - and the film angered both Communist and Church authorities by showing its young characters’ explicit rejection of any ideological affinity.With an outstanding cast headed by Tadeusz Łomnicki, Polish superstar Zbigniew Cybulski, a young Roman Polanski and featuring an incredible jazz score by renowned composer Krzysztof Komeda, this is a key film of the period and in its director’s oeuvre - and one that has substantially grown in stature over time.",

    "price": "£90.00",
    "description": "Arrow VideoCultural icon, anti-establishment statement, sadistic lord of carnival horror! With his iconic long fingernails, top hat and cape, Zé do Caixão (Coffin Joe) was the creation of Brazilian filmmaker José Mojica Marins, who wrote, directed and starred in a series of outrageous movies from 1964 to 2008.An unholy undertaker in search of the perfect woman to propagate his bloodline, Zé do Caixão made his screen debut with the first Brazilian-produced horror film, At Midnight I’ll Take Your Soul. Three years later, his quest would continue in This Night I’ll Possess Your Corpse, with Zé embarking on an even more brutal campaign of terror, aided and abetted by his hunchbacked assistant. The Strange World of Coffin Joe, meanwhile, is an anthology of three short horror films featuring a strange dollmaker, a necrophiliac balloon seller with a foot fetish, and a psychotic professor involved in sadistic rituals. Sex, perversion and sadism abound in The Awakening of the Beast as a psychiatrist experiments on four volunteers with Lsd in this surreal examination of 60s drug culture.Diverging from horror toward satirical black comedy, The End of Man sees a naked stranger emerge from the sea to perform miracles in a nearby town and become a modern messiah whose deeds will affect the whole world. Rarely-seen sequel When the Gods Fall Asleep continues this blackly comic trajectory as our messianic cult figure sets out to right wrongs, expose corruption and end social unrest. The Strange Hostel of Naked Pleasures brings Zé do Caixão back to the screen as the proprietor of an isolated guest house where, on a dark and stormy night, an eclectic group of strangers seek shelter. In Hellish Flesh, Dr George Medeiros is a brilliant scientist, but a neglectful husband whose wife takes a lover and plans to murder George for his fortune, but the doctor is only disfigured and returns with a plan for revenge! Meanwhile, in Hallucinations of a Deranged Mind, the colleagues of a psychiatric doctor driven to insanity by nightmare visions of Zé do Caixão enlist the character’s creator, José Mojica Marins, to convince the patient that Zé does not exist - but all is not as it seems! Finally, in Embodiment of Evil, Marins returns to the role that made his name one last time, as Zé do Caixão emerges onto the streets of São Paulo in 2008, haunted by ghostly visions and the spirits of past victims, and still in pursuit of the woman who can give him the perfect child.Newly restored from the best available elements and packed with new and archival extras, Inside the Mind of Coffin Joe is a love letter to one of the great iconoclasts of horror, who forged his films in the face of military dictatorship and religious censorship to become Brazil’s national Boogeyman.Product

During their flight, Otsuya's beauty attracts the gaze of Seikichi, a mysterious master tattooist who sees her pristine white skin as the perfect canvas for his art. The image of the large demonic spider that he emblazons across Otsuya's back marks her as the property of another man, radically altering her relationships with all around her as her personality transforms under its influence.Available for the first time outside of Japan in a new 4K restoration, Irezumi sports some of Japanese cinema's most respected talent of its day both in front of and behind the camera. The bewitching cinematography by Kazuo Miyagawa (Rashomon, Ugetsu) captures the sensual atmosphere of the period setting, while the script by Kaneto Shindo (Onibaba, Kuroneko) lends a modern twist to this feverish meditation on obsession and the act of creation.Special FeaturesHigh Definition Blu-ray (1080p) presentation from a new 4K scanOriginal uncompressed Japanese mono audioOptional English subtitlesBrand new audio commentary by Japanese cinema scholar David DesserNewly filmed introduction by Japanese cinema expert Tony RaynsOut of the Darkness, a brand new visual essay by Asian cinema scholar Daisuke MiyaoOriginal TrailerImage GalleryReversible sleeve featuring original and newly commissioned artwork by Tony Stella",

From cult director Nico Mastorakis, Island of Death is a travelogue of atrocities with scenes so strong that the British Government was once compelled to ban it as a \"video nasty\".Arriving on the idyllic Greek island, Christopher and Celia appear to be every inch the perfect, handsome young couple. Little do the welcoming locals realise that they are in fact a pair of murderous degenerates, determined to spread their own particular brand of perversion across the island. DIY crucifixions, opportunistic bestiality, sexual peeing and murder by all conceivable forms ensue – including death by makeshift blowtorch, samurai sword, dump truck and more!Shocking, brutal and totally politically incorrect in its outlook, Island of Death is a gruelling cinematic experience devised by director Mastorakis to out-do the excesses of The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, which he was hugely inspired by. Now fully uncut and newly-restored from the original negative, fans can enjoy Island of Death in all its sleazy, lurid glory.Special FeaturesBrand new restoration from the original negativeHigh Definition Blu-ray (1080p) and Standard Definition DVD presentationOptional English SDH subtitles for the deaf and hard of hearingBrand new interview with director Nico MastorakisThe Films of Nico Mastorakis – the director hosts this documentary covering his varied career in cinema, including a look at Island of DeathReversible sleeve featuring original and newly commissioned artwork by Graham Humphreys",

When he made the move to Hollywood, he adapted her novel Rebecca, the end results securing the Academy Award for Best Picture. When he needed to follow up the groundbreaking horror of Psycho, he adapted her short story The Birds and created another milestone of the genre. But before these came Jamaica Inn, based on Du Maurier's classic tale of wreckers in 19th century Cornwall.Recently orphaned Mary Yellan (Maureen O'Hara in her first major film role) arrives at Jamaica Inn from Ireland to live with her aunt. Unaware that it serves as the headquarters for a murderous gang responsible for shipwrecks along the Cornish coast, she soon finds herself embroiled in backstabbing, conspiracy and villainy presided over by the local squire, Sir Humphrey Pengallan (Charles Laughton).Though dominated by Laughton's wonderfully flamboyant performance, Jamaica Inn also finds room for a rogue's gallery of British character actors including Robert Newton (David Lean's Oliver Twist), Basil Radford (The Lady Vanishes), Leslie Banks (The Most Dangerous Game) and Mervyn Johns (Dead of Night). It also stands out as one of the most atmospheric of Hitchcock's British films as well as one of his most unfairly neglected works.Special FeaturesNew 4K digital restoration by the Cohen Film Collection and the BFIHigh Definition Blu-ray (1080p) and Standard Definition DVD presentationsUncompressed Mono 1.0 PCM AudioOptional English subtitles for the deaf and hard of hearingAudio commentary by film critic Jeremy ArnoldShipwrecked in a Studio, a visual essay by Donald Spoto, author of The Dark Side Of Genius: The Life Of Alfred Hitchcock and Spellbound by Beauty: Alfred Hitchcock and His Leading LadiesTrailerReversible sleeve featuring original and newly commissioned artwork by Dan Mumford",

Haru, a college student, is frustrated by the lack of any real spark between her and her slobbish and indifferent boyfriend, who only seems to be interested in her for sex. One day, while brooding over a cappuccino in a cafe, she catches the eye of Riko. Riko joins her table and the two strike up a conversation in which she explains her job as a \"medical artist\", something slightly different from a prosthetics, in that rather than create body parts that attempt to emulate the function of those lost through accident and disease, her role is to cure the psychological traumas arising from the patient's physical deficiencies by balancing body and soul, creating parts that aesthetically make up for the loss. While Haru might be physically intact, Riko sees in her a certain emotional wanting to which she might provide a cure, and the two begin an all-encompassing relationship that draws Haru away from her dissatisfying routine and into a new and more emotionally fulfilling area of her life.",

The lives of nearly half the planet are in Stalin's hands. A military surgeon, General Yuri Georgievich Klensky (Yuri Tsurilo), finds himself a target of the \"\"Doctors' Plot\"\": the anti-Semitic conspiracy accusing Jewish doctors in Moscow of planning to assassinate the Soviet elite. Pursued, abused, and marked for the gulags, Yuri is chased and dragged through a Stalinist Soviet nightmare. His desperate, jolting journey encapsulates the madness of the era.Directed by Aleksei German (Hard to Be a God), Khrustalyov, My Car! proved wildly provocative when it was screened at the 1998 Cannes film festival, despite being championed as the best film of the festival by the president of the Cannes jury that year, Martin Scorsese.

With the entire property fitted out with cameras, their every move will be recorded. But when the house locks down, trapping the youngsters within, it soon becomes clear that something sinister is afoot. Scream - you're on camera…Marketed as little more than a generic horror flick at the time of its release, Kolobos, far from being a run-of-the-mill slasher clone, has much more in common with the booby-trap stylings of Cube (1997) and the reality TV theme of My Little Eye (2002), which it preempted by some three years.DIRECTOR-APPROVED SPECIAL EDITION CONTENTS:Brand new 2K restoration from the original negativeOriginal Stereo and 5.1 audio optionsAudio commentary with co-writers and co-directors Daniel Liatowitsch and David Todd OcvirkReal World Massacre: The Making of Kolobos - brand new featurette on the making-of Kolobos including interviews with Daniel Liatowitsch, David Todd Ocvirk and co-writer/producer Nne EbongFace to Faceless - a brand new Interview with \"Faceless\" actor Ilia VolokSlice & Dice: The Music of Kolobos - a brand new interview with composer William KiddBehind-the-Scenes Image GallerySuper 8 short film by Daniel Liatowitsch with commentaryOriginal Trailer",

Through her narration we quickly learn she see s double of everyone, one good and one evil. The problem is she can t tell which one is real, and is constantly moving from apartment to apartment as she assaults neighbours she fears are out to harm her or her baby. Every moment of her life devolves in to paranoid induced state, where she worries what tragedy awaits her son. She cuts herself in an effort to remind her that she is real, and what she s experiencing is not a dream or delusion. The only time she feels at peace, when all her anxiety melts away and she feels whole, is when she sings. Soon Daijiro is taken from her, as authorities believe she is in fact abusing her child, and place him in the custody of her sister. At the same time, a famous author (played by Tsukamoto) who hears Kotoko s singing on a bus begins to stalk her, mesmerized by what he hears. He follows her around, desperate to strike up a relationship with her, no matter what the emotional or physical cost it may have on him or her.Extras:Interview with Shinya TsukamotoTrailer",

On one side of the yard live the men, most sent here for 're-education'. On the other side, are a group of women interned for the crime of attempted defection. Separately, the two groups lazily toil, sorting out piles of scrap metal (one huge pile is nothing less than a veritable mountain of crucifixes and religious icons); together, they flirt, philosophize, and occasionally sneak off behind the hillocks of slag to make love.Larks on a String is at once a stinging indictment of the repressive politics of Czechoslovakia's past, and an endearing comedy and affecting love story.",

    "title": "Lies and Deceit | Five Films By Claude Chabrol | Limited Edition Blu-ray",
    "price": "£60.00",
    "description": "Arrow FilmsToo often overlooked and undervalued, Claude Chabrol was the first of the Cahiers du Cinema critics to release a feature film and would be among the most prolific. The sneaky anarchist of the French New Wave, he embraced genre as a means of lifting the lid on human nature. Nothing is sacred and nothing is certain in the films of Claude Chabrol: anything can be corrupted, and usually will be.The hidden meaness of provincial life is at the heart of Cop Au Vin (Poulet au vinaigre), as deaths and disappearances intersect around the attempt by a corrupt syndicate of property developers to force a disabled woman and her son from their home. Actor Jean Poiret would prove so compelling as the laconic Detective Inspector Lavardin good cop/bad cop all in one that the sequel would be titled after him. Inspector Lavardin sees the titular detective investigating the murder of a wealthy and respected catholic author, renowned for his outspoken views against indecency, whose body is found naked and dead on the beach. In Madame Bovary, Chabrol directs one of his greatest collaborators, actress Isabelle Huppert, in perhaps the definitive depiction of Flaubert's classic heroine. Meanwhile Betty, adapted from the novel of the same name by Maigret author Georges Simenon, is a scathing attack on the uppermiddle classes, featuring an extraordinary performance by Marie Trintignant as a woman spiraling into alcoholism, but fighting to redefine herself. Finally, in Torment (L'enfer) Chabrol picks up a project abandoned by Henri Georges Clouzot, in which a husband's jealousy and suspicion of his wife drive him to appalling extremes. Francois Cluzet and Emmanuelle Beart give career best performances as the husband and wife tearing each other apart.With brand new digital restorations, this inaugural Arrow Films collection of Claude Chabrol on Bluray brings together a wealth of passionate contributors and archival extras to shed fresh light on the films and the filmmaker. Dark, witty, ruthless, mischievous: if you've never seen Chabrol before, you're in for a treat. If you have, they've never looked better.Limited Edition Contents:High definition (1080p) Bluray presentations of all five filmsNew 4K restorations of Madame Bovary, Betty, and Torment (L'enfer)Original lossless French PCM mono audio on Cop Au Vin (Poulet au vinaigre), Inspector Lavardin, Madame Bovary, and BettyOriginal lossless French PCM stereo audio on Torment (L'enfer)Optional English SubtitlesFully illustrated 80page collector's booklet of new writing on the films by film critics Martyn Conterio, Kat Ellinger, Philip Kemp, and Sam Wigley plus select archival materialLimited edition packaging featuring newly commissioned artwork by Tony StellaDisc One:Brand new commentary by film critic Ben SachsAn Interview with Ian Christie, a brand new interview with film historian Ian Christie about the cinema of Claude ChabrolClaude Chabrol at the BFI, Chabrol discusses his career in this hour long archival interview conducted onstage at the National Film Theatre in 1994Claude Chabrol, Jean Poiret & Stephane Audran in conversation, an archival Swiss TV episode in which the director and cast discuss Cop Au Vin (Poulet au vinaigre)Archive introduction by film scholar Joël MagnySelect scene commentaries by Claude ChabrolTheatrical TrailerImage GalleryDisc Two:Brand new commentary by film critic Ben SachsWhy Chabrol?, a brand new interview with film critic Sam Wigley about why the films of Claude Chabrol remain essential viewingArchive introduction by film scholar Joël MagnySelect scene commentaries by Claude ChabrolTheatrical TrailerImage GalleryDisc Three:Brand new commentary by film critic Kat EllingerImagining Emma: Madame Bovary on screen, a brand new visual essay by film historian Pamela HutchinsonArchive introduction by film scholar Joël MagnySelect scene commentaries by Claude ChabrolTheatrical TrailerImage GalleryDisc Four:Brand new commentary by film critic Kat EllingerBetty, from Simenon to Chabrol, a brand new visual essay by French Cinema historian Ginette VincendeauAn Interview with Ros Schwartz, a brand new interview with the English translator of the Georges Simenon novel on which the film is basedArchive introduction by film scholar Joël Magny Select scene commentaries by Claude ChabrolTheatrical TrailerImage GalleryDisc Five:Brand new commentary by film critics Alexandra HellerNicholas and Josh NelsonOn Henri Georges Clouzot, an archival interview with Claude Chabrol in which he talks about fellow director Henri Georges Clouzot (Les diaboliques), whose original attempt to make L'enfer was abandoned, and how the project came to ChabrolAn Interview with Marin Karmitz, an archival interview with Marin Karmitz, Chabrol's most frequent producerArchive introduction by film scholar Joël MagnySelect scene commentaries by Claude ChabrolTheatrical TrailerImage Gallery",

Swedish director Jonas Åkerlund renders the world of black metal with immense detail whilst also coaxing superb performances from his young cast.Specail Edition Contents:High Definition Blu-ray (1080p) presentation5.1 DTS-HD Master AudioOptional English subtitles for the deaf and hard of hearingNew interview with writer-director Jonas ÅkerlundNew interviews with actors Sam Coleman, Jason Arnopp and Arion CsiharNew interview with Special Effects artist Dan MartinAn on-stage introduction to the film by Thurston MooreImage galleriesOriginal trailer",
